<p>I've had some time recently to develop a couple of WordPress plugins. They're my first real plugins, I've built some functionality into custom themes I developed that could be spun off into plugins, but other people eventually built those better than I would have, or I built them so specifically tied into the theme that spinning them into plugins would have been more work than they're worth. That said, I'm pretty proud of these plugins in that they solve some key problems I've been dealing with for a while.</p>

<p>The first plugin is called Double Return and the problem it solves is one related to a mismatch in the way most people write in Microsoft Word and the way most developers write WP Themes. When people write, they use the return key to add a new line. If they want space between paragraphs, they add a second return. In HTML this looks like:</p>

<pre>
<p>Some text in a paragraph.</p>
<p>Some text in another paragraph.</p>
</pre>
