Welcome to my blog! My name is Greg Boone, I work for <a
href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a> as a jack-of-all-trades type (we're all
that type). I grew up in a suburb of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St.
Paul, Minnesota. In previous lives I was a <a
href="https://cct.georgetown.edu">grad student at Georgetown University</a>,
an <a
href="https://www.harmsboone.org/category/blog/keeping-up-with-the-magyars">
English teacher in Hungary</a>, and <a
href="https://www.harmsboone.org/category/blog/korea">South Korea</a>, and
a student at <a href="http://gustavus.edu">Gustavus Adolphus College</a>.

I love technology, travel, biking, and home brewing. I write mostly about
that first one here. I'm particularly interested in how technologies and
society interact including issues like privacy, hacktivism, and education
technology. There's a good chance I'll write about any of those things in
addition to the things I learn every day at work. Interesting side note,
even though I love WordPress and spent a lot of time developing for it,
this blog runs Jekyll. Why? I like competition. Static site generators like
this one are definitely that for WordPress. I also like simplicity,
something Jekyll has in spades. This blog is about learning new things and
it's only fitting that I'm learning the system while I make it.
