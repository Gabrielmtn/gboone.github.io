	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In my last post I wrote about two testing libraries for WordPress and discussed the difference between integration tests and unit tests. I also mentioned a concept called test driven development and breifly explained how it might help write better code from the start. This post will expand on that and show how to write a simple WordPress plugin from a test-first approach. Since we&rsquo;re writing unit tests, we&rsquo;re going to use WP-Mock to create a test double for us and we&rsquo;ll use PHPunit for our test runner.</p>

<p>TDD starts with an idea. In this case, let&rsquo;s say we have a plugin that will add some metadata to a post with the title &ldquo;Test&rdquo;. Since that&rsquo;s going to require us to mock some WordPress core functionality, <a href="http://github.com/10up/wp-mock">make sure WP-Mock is configured in your working environment</a>. We&rsquo;ll should start by writing a test that verifies the metadata was attached to the post. In order to write unit tests we first need to extend the base test suite. In our plugin&rsquo;s root directory, add a directory called &lsquo;tests&rsquo; and inside it create a file called test-plugin.php. To extend the test suite, we simply create a class (this is explained inthe WP-Mock README):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;?
</span><span class='line'>    Class OurTestSuite extends extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>?&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now that we have a class, we can call any of PHPunit&rsquo;s methods for testing including all of their assertions. Inside this OurTestSuite is where we will write all our testing methods. We start with setUp and tearDown, commonly named methods that instantiate some conditions we will want for all our classes. We&rsquo;ll want to make sure our setUp and tearDown methods clean up our test environment as well as any mocks we create out of WP_Mock. So we&rsquo;ll declare:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;?php
</span><span class='line'>    public funciton setUp() {
</span><span class='line'>        parent::setUp();
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    public function tearDown() {
</span><span class='line'>        parent::tearDown();
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>?&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If we had other things we wanted in here, other objects we want available throughout the test suite, etc., we could declare those too. If you run the test now you&rsquo;ll get some output, but no tests will run because we haven&rsquo;t written any. Now let&rsquo;s write our test for our <code>save_meta</code> method. There are three basic sections to our test: Arrange, Act, Assert. The first section is for all the bits our method needs for input. In our case, we&rsquo;ll need the post ID for a post called &ldquo;Test&rdquo; and a key and value pair to save as metadata. Since the ID could be any integer on a given system, we can arrange our test with any integer we like. The next piece, the key-value pair, will be set in the method, but we&rsquo;ll want to decide now what they&rsquo;ll be.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Act&rdquo; section is where we call the method. In this case, we&rsquo;re going to call a method called <code>save_meta_data</code> out of the <code>MethodsClass</code> object. Finally, the &ldquo;Assert&rdquo; section is where we decide what the method should expect to see at the end. This section might be empty depending on whether the method under test returns an output or simply passes data somewherelse. In our case, it&rsquo;s the latter. Instead, for us, the test passes if <code>update_post_meta</code> is called exactly once. Right now our test is looking something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;?php
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>    public function testTestPostExpectsMetaDataSaved(){
</span><span class='line'>        // Arrange
</span><span class='line'>        $post_id = 42;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>        // Act
</span><span class='line'>        $methods = new MethodsClass();
</span><span class='line'>        $methods-&gt;save_meta_data($post_id);
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>        // Assert
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>?&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Not a bad looking test, but we have some mocking to do. We already know we&rsquo;ll need to mock <code>update_post_meta()</code>, but we&rsquo;re also going to need <code>get_post()</code> as well. In both cases, we&rsquo;re going to make PHPunit handle calls to those methods and return what we want back. In this case, from <code>get_post()</code> we&rsquo;re going to want it to return <code>$post-&gt;Name</code> equal to &ldquo;Test&rdquo;, so we can positively test that the post named &ldquo;Test&rdquo; get&rsquo;s updated meta data. We know what to expect if we call <code>update_post_meta</code>: if all is well with our WordPress install, we expect it would add new information to the post object. So we don&rsquo;t need to verify that, all we really need to do is verify it&rsquo;s being called exactly once. So let&rsquo;s add our mocks to the &ldquo;Arrange&rdquo; section.</p>

<p>Fully mocking a function like <code>get_post()</code> uses the static method <code>wpFunction()</code> from the WP_Mock class. We can call it with: <code>\WP_Mock::wpFunciton()</code>. We can also pass wpFunction some parameters like &lsquo;times&rsquo;, for how many times we expect the mocked function to fire, and &lsquo;parameters&rsquo;, and &lsquo;return&rsquo;. These will all help us send some data to <code>get_post</code>, have it handled predictably, and return something else. A full example is below.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;?php
</span><span class='line'>    ...
</span><span class='line'>    // Arrange
</span><span class='line'>    $post = \WP_Mock::wpFunction('get_post')
</span><span class='line'>    ...
</span><span class='line'>?&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, we need to address <code>update_post_meta</code>, but since we don&rsquo;t particularly care what we get back from this method, we can instead &lsquo;stub&rsquo; it. WP_Mock has a help method for wpFunction that make this easy, it&rsquo;s called <code>wpPassthruFunction()</code> and can take many of the same parameters, but fills in the return value for you. In our case, we want to know that update_post_meta fired once, so we can write something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;?php
</span><span class='line'>    ...
</span><span class='line'>    // Arrange
</span><span class='line'>    \WP_Mock::wpPassthruFunction('update_post_meta', array('times' =&gt; 1));
</span><span class='line'>    ...
</span><span class='line'>?&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, if we go to our test runner and run <code>phpunit</code>, we get an F, or maybe an E, since we haven&rsquo;t written any code yet. Now let&rsquo;s make that test pass.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Testing WordPress has become a favorite topic of mine lately: moving away from hitting refresh and toward something more holistic, reliable, and automatable. I&rsquo;ve written before about <a href="http://greg.harmsboone.org/blog/2013/08/17/how-can-i-do-browser-testing-with-wordpress/">a testing method called called browser testing</a>, which verifies a webpage has some expected behavior. These kinds of tests are great but they&rsquo;re not perfect. They require a lot o dependencies and that someone else would need to verify your code. There is a better way, one that doesn&rsquo;t require any of those dependencies and verfies the code down to the exact lines you wrote—it can even be independent of WordPress. It&rsquo;s called unit testing and it will make you a better developer.</p>

<p>Unit testing is a method that reduces and tests the system down to it&rsquo;s smallest functional pieces. Each &lsquo;unit&rsquo; should be as isolated as possible from any others in the system. The test should verify only the correctness of one unit. It has many benefits for all of software development but is relatively new to WordPress. It&rsquo;s hard to say for sure why but there have been two important advancements in the area recently that will hopefully compel us WordPress devs to be more intentional about testing and verifying our code.</p>

<p>The first is the WordPress Unit Test Suite (WPUTS), detailed on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/automated-testing/">WP Core development blog</a>. This suite contains tests covering much of the core files installed with a WordPress.org site. This test suite can even be installed <a href="http://wp-cli.org/">through the fantastic WP-CLI project</a>. According to <a href="https://travis-ci.org/tierra/wordpress/jobs/15867662">a recent build on Travis</a>, 1889 tests are currently available. That build shows the output of PHP&rsquo;s test runner, <a href="http://phpunit.de">PHPunit</a> at around line 724. Each test generates either a dot for a passed test or an S, I, F or E if the test is (s)kipped, (i)gnored, (f)ails, or encounters an (e)rror. In that build you see only 2 failures and a whole bunch of skipped tests. You can also see, at line 777, that phpunit took 1:28 to run all the tests and used 141.75MB of memory. That&rsquo;s pretty good for testing an application the size of WordPress. <a href="https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/wiki/Plugin-Unit-Tests">With a few simple commands in WP-CLI</a> you can install these tests on your own and extend them to cover your own plugin.</p>

<p>WPUTS was introduced sometime in late 2012 and unit testing through the core suite was recently integrated into the core development workflow. Another important project is <a href="https://github.com/10up/wp_mock/">WP-Mock</a>, a wonderful project from the folks at 10up that allows you to &lsquo;mock&rsquo; or &lsquo;stub&rsquo; only the parts of WordPress you need for each test. If you need call <code>update_post_meta()</code>, WP-Mock would allow you to just pass an integer, a key, and a value. The ideas is if your code verfies with a <a href="http://phpunit.de/manual/3.7/en/test-doubles.html">test double</a>, it will verify once it&rsquo;s hooked into the real thing.</p>

<p>There are two key differences between these two test suites: dependencies and what is tested. Compared to browser tests, both suites remove your code&rsquo;s dependency on existing content, a web server, selenium, and behave, but WPUTS still requires WordPress and a MySQL database on top of your code, PHP, and PHPunit. WP-Mock requires only the last three. This means, if you want to run your tests in a continuous integration server like Jenkins or Travis, with WP-Mock the only thing you need to set up that environment is your code, PHP, and PHPunit.</p>

<p>With WPUTS, what you are really testing is whether your code properly integrates with its dependencies, and are useful for exactly that purpose. A WordPress plugin, for example, might have integration tests written to determine whether post meta data is in fact updated when <code>update_post_meta</code> is called within one of its methods. That does not necessarily verify whether the code written is correct. True unit tests start lower, focusing on whether the code <em>you</em> wrote for <em>this</em> method generates the correct output if the dependencies behave as expected. The difference is subtle but also important.</p>

<p>With this distinction in mind, WPUTS might be better named the &lsquo;WordPress Integration Test Suite&rsquo; as it allows you to access to a full installation of WordPress and manipulation of its database. What it doesn&rsquo;t do is tell you whether you&rsquo;re manipulating that database too much. Maybe your method called <code>update_post_meta</code> twice, WPUTS will not necessarily tell you that. It will only tell you that the post was, in fact, updated. That&rsquo;s useful, but so is knowing you only did it once. Writing to a database can be expensive, doing it too many times might slow down your application.</p>

<p>Writing tests before writing code is called Test Driven Development and is a software engineering best practice. It forces you to write your test, then write code to make your test pass. In the end, this makes you a better developer because you are focused to break your problems down into smaller pieces that do more discrete testable things. How to write those tests is a subject for another blog.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>While a colleague and I were discussing the rollout of a new feature to our public facing website, he asked me if it would be possible to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; the new content behind a toggle. Effectively, he was asking me to write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle">feature switch</a>, a best practice of continuous integration that <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">allows you to push some source code while hiding future features</a>. WordPress has some of this idea built into it&rsquo;s core: plugins, for example, can be activated and deactivated to turn things on and off. Within plugins and themes, options pages can be used to turn on different features. SEO plugins, for example, let users turn on and off different optimizaiton tools. Feature switches are a little different, and in our case leverage the power of Apache environment variables to show and hide different parts of our site.</p>

		<p>Custom post types and taxonomies are one of the most powerful tools to transform WordPress from a blogging platform to a full CMS. One of the most common problems beginning developers have when starting to use them is understanding how they work. It&rsquo;s easy to think that calling <code>register_post_type</code> is all it takes only to discover that their new post type archives are not working. This likely leads to a long dive into first (hopefully) the code to see if something was written incorrectly and then to the WordPress support forums to figure out what the problem is. 99% percent of the time I wager it&rsquo;s because the developer forgot to flush WordPress&rsquo;s rewrite rules.

		<p>Browser testing is a basic component of a concept called behavior driven development (BDD), and one that has helped me become a better WordPress developer in the last few months. The concept of BDD is simple: test and develop around your software&rsquo;s expected behavior. <a href="http://blog.excella.com/how-can-wordpress-developers-do-behavior-driven-development-bdd/">I recently wrote about BDD for Excella&rsquo;s company blog</a>, and this post will go a bit more technical than that. The upshot of behavior testing is you can find problems with both your code and your requirements. Before we get into that, a bit of background on the tools.

		<p>About a week ago I successfully migrated some of my posts from <a href="http://harmsboone.org">harmsboone.org</a> to this blog, I also wrote a post about <a href="http://greg.harmsboone.org/blog/2013/07/28/what-i-learned-about-git-this-week/">some things I learned about git that week</a>. WordPress is great. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it (and I almost always do) if it weren&rsquo;t. For someone who wants to spin up a blog and maybe some day more in a pinch, WordPress is the go-to platform. In fact, the rest of harmsboone.org still runs it. Earlier this year, though, Danielle and I started talking about ditching the one-blog-for-both solution. When we were both living and teaching abroad sharing one blog made sense but now with the both of us starting different careers, we have different things to say.</p>

<p>We decided to keep HarmsBoone.org as an archive of the last four years and also create new blogs for the both of us. Since I was starting from scratch anyway, might as well strike out with something new.</p>

		<p>I love hidden features in software. Whether it&rsquo;s finding a <a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/">konami code in unexpected places</a> or that I can add or remove all the dots and underscores to my gmail address I want and I&rsquo;ll still get the emails, something about them are great. That was what made Zach Holman&rsquo;s presentation &lsquo;More Git &amp; GitHub Secrets&rsquo; such an enjoyable read this week.</p>

<p>Git can be at once incredibly powerful and overwhelming. It has one of the longest manual pages I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and sub-commands have an equally long manuals. Picking up the basics, it&rsquo;s easier to rely on a book, the book: <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">ProGit</a>, which can take you from installation to power user, but there are all kinds of hidden features built into git you can only find by using git <em>all the time</em>.</p>

<p>I get the impression that people at GitHub spend a lot of time digging into git and it&rsquo;s probably why GitHub is so good at what it does. And, like git, it&rsquo;s full of hidden features. For example, in <a href="http://zachholman.com">@holman&rsquo;s</a> recent talk, he talked about fetching pull requests into a specific branch, a conveinent short cut to the typical:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b pr
git pull &lt;git URI&gt; &lt;branch&gt;
&lt;fix any mrege conflicts&gt;
git checkout &lt;branch&gt;
git merge pr
</code></pre>

<p>You can fetch a pull request into a branch with:</p>

<pre><code>git fetch origin pull/&lt;##&gt;/head:pr
</code></pre>

<p>Woah, way handy, git, GitHub! Another highlight, <code>git merge --abort</code>. You know that one time you accepted a pull request into the wrong branch and had a billion merge conflicts? This one little command will abort the merge and reset your tree without any rebasing or having to push <code>git commit -m 'fixing erroneous merge to the wrong branch'</code> to your remote.</p>

<p>There are lots of other great tips in this and Holman&rsquo;s previous talks. <a href="http://zachholman.com/talk/more-git-and-github-secrets/">Check them out at his website, zachholman.com.</a></p>

		<h2>Abstract</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The United States Constitution instructed the First Congress of the United States to enact laws &#8220;securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&#8221; This instruction, commonly referred to as the Intellectual Property Clause, demanded a set of laws based on the broad idea that inventors are best incentivized and remunerated for their works through a system of guaranteed exclusive rights. What exactly the scope of those rights were, who had authority to hand them out, and under what conditions they would be given, were all left to Congress to sort out; it was among the earliest controversies over science and technology in the United States of America.

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		Inspired by the <a href="http://googleearthtimemachine.blogspot.fr/">Google Earth Time Machine blog</a> highlighted by Kottke.org a few days ago, I decided to see how far back the imagery over my college campus reached. I figured it being in rural area, there was probably a lot of agricultural aerial photography going on, but I was wrong, the imagery only went back as far as 1992. Perhaps if I paid for some extra features it would stretch back further, but who knows. Those familiar with Gustavus Adolphus College will recall the infamous 1998 Tornado, the ten-year anniversary of which was commemorated while I was a student. The big thing I remember hearing about the campus was tree loss. The big takeaway watching the recruitment video from the 90s they were still using when I was a freshman was &#8216;where did all those giant trees on the quad go? What I did not think about, and what never really got talked about, was how many more trees there are now, and this was immediately evident comparing the 92 aerial imagery with the photographs taken 20 years later.
<a href="http://www.harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GAC121.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1596" title="Gustavus 2012" src="http://www.harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GAC121-512x318.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="318" /></a>

One thing that was especially interesting was where there were more trees in 2012, where the trees were smaller, and where they were actually larger. The Linnaeus Arboretum sort of hugs the Westernmost part of the campus. In 2012 the Arb, as we affectionately knew it, is densely populated with trees on the North side, strikingly so compared to the same image in 1992. The South side is a bit more dense, but, being that it&#8217;s a bit more prairie on that end of the Arb, it&#8217;s not as noticeable. What&#8217;s strange here is that all the trees actually look a lot bigger, 20 years bigger, in fact. Did the Arb somehow survive the tornado, or was it replanted with really big trees? On the South-Southeast side of the campus, headed down the hill from (the old) Old Main the tree cover is definitely sparser in &#8216;92, but the trees much larger. There are also more paved paths headed up the hill from Rundstrom Hall, something I would have welcomed when I lived there.

Apart from trees, the campus was busy constructing, moving, or demolishing campus facilities in the last twenty years. The facilities are highlighted on the 2012 map <em>supra</em> and color-coded according to whether they are sports (blue), academic (yellow), housing (green), public spaces (orange), and parking (red). I also made some notes in white. One thing is clear straight away, housing at Gustavus has changed a lot in the last twenty years. On the Southern edge of the campus were added the Arbor View Apartments, on the Western edge before the Arb, Southwest and Prairie View halls (the latter meant to be temporary after the tornado) and the International Center. On the South-Southeast side of campus (a barren patch of grass circled in green) was Wahlstrom Hall, a building demolished the summer before I enrolled. Gusties have also changed the way they play sports, with the football field moved to behind Lund Center on the North End of campus. The new stadium, built in the summer of 2007, is right next to a soccer field, and is across Ring Rd. from a baseball field and a multi-purpose field for practices (and other things? My golf class met there, I imagine that&#8217;s not all). All of these fields are either new or have moved since 1992. The 2012 stadium is directly atop the 1992 baseball field, and the 2012 baseball and multi-purpose fields appear to be atop 1992&#8217;s farmland. It&#8217;s not clear whether the rugby pitch behind Southwest Hall is new, or if it was so used in 1992. The 1992 football stadium is now covered by a mall stretching NE from Christ Chapel, one of two new public spaces. The others were an expansion of the campus center that happened after the tornado to include the Marketplace, and the creation of the Big Hill Farm West of the Arb.

<a href="http://www.harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GAC92.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1594" title="Gustavus 1992" src="http://www.harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GAC92-512x319.png" alt="" width="512" height="319" /></a>

The last thing I noted was how little the campus expanded its academic buildings. The three buildings in yellow are Mattson Hall, housing the Nursing and Education Departments; Old Main, renovated in 2005; and Beck Academic Hall completed about one year ago. This illustration of how the campus has changed is by no means scientific. Certainly academics can expand without constructing new buildings unlike, say, housing, and it&#8217;s possible some of these buildings were renovated internally, or that departments were moved around campus as they outgrew their homes. The old library, better known as the SSC in my day or A. H. Anderson Hall officially, is currently not occupied by any department, though I believe is still used for its classrooms (correct me if I&#8217;m wrong). The departments that were once there have all moved to Beck Hall now. It is nevertheless interesting to think about this aerial transformation in terms of a college&#8217;s priorities.

I&#8217;m far from the first to note that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/business/colleges-begin-to-confront-higher-costs-and-students-debt.html?pagewanted=all">college</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/05/16/136214779/college-student-debt-grows-is-it-worth-it">costs</a> <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/26/pf/college/college_tuition_cost/index.htm">are</a> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2012/03/19/why-college-prices-keep-rising/">on</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130895432">the</a> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/how-in-the-world-did-college-costs-rise-15-in-only-2-years/258463/">rise</a>, and I&#8217;m far from the first to wonder why colleges <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/pitchroom/are-college-sports-worth-the-cost/7827/">seem to spend more on fancy athletic and housing facilities than the academic program</a> (and whether that even matters), and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/05/28/120528taco_talk_lemann">what drives</a> <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/college_bound/2012/04/some_perspective_on_the_high_cost_of_college.html">spending by college administrators</a>. Nevertheless, it is hard to argue that, at least from a bird&#8217;s eye view, my college seems to have its priorities in two key areas: athletics, and student facilities.
