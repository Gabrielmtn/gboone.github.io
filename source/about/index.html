<p>Welcome to my blog! My name is Greg Boone, I work for <a href="http://excella.com">Excella Consulting</a> as a <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress developer</a>. I recently spoke at a WordPress in Government conference about how automated browser testing can make better developers. I grew up in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. In previous lives I was a <a href="http://cct.georgetown.edu">grad student at Georgetown University</a>, an <a href="http://www.harmsboone.org/category/blog/keeping-up-with-the-magyars">English teacher in Hungary</a>, an <a href="http://www.harmsboone.org/category/blog/korea">English Teacher in South Korea</a>, and a student at <a href="http://gustavus.edu">Gustavus Adolphus College</a>. The blog's name, "Merge Conflicts," comes from the strange transition I've take from Academic life, where I thought I would spend the next phase of my life, to professional software development where I've suddenly found myself working. In development, merge conflicts are what you get when old and new code can't figure out which is correct.</p>

<p>I love technology, travel, biking, and home brewing. I write mostly about that first one here. I'm particularly interested in how technologies and society interact including issues like privacy, hacktivism, and education technology. There's a good chance I'll write about any of those things in addition to the things I learn every day at work. Interesting side note, even though I love and develop WordPress, this blog runs <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. Why? I like competition. Octopress and Jekyll based blogging platforms are definitely that for WordPress. I also like simplicity, another thing Octopress has in spades. I also like learning new things. That's what this blog is about, it's only fitting that I'm learning the system while I make it.</p>
