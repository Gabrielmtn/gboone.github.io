		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When it rains it pours. While this old saw usually refers to a series or chain of bad events each subsequent event getting worse and worse as the event or moment in time proceedslike when an organization suddenly sees four of its six VPs resign in quick succession, when it rains it poursduring the South Korean monsoon season it is quite literally true. Work is only about a twenty minute walk from home for me, and though many of my co-workers take a roughly $3 cab to work each day, lately Danielle and I have taken to walking. The only real problem with our it's-only-a-twenty-minute-walk-why-would-we-take-a-cab approach was exposed on our second day of work at our hogwon when a little bit of what looked like manageable rain turned nearly instantly into a downpour so heavy it was as if the air had suddenly turned to water. Thus began my first full day as an English teacher.
<!--more-->
To say that I live in Seoul is a bit disingenuousthat way that saying someone who lives in North Branch, MN lives in Minneapolis or St. Paul, or someone in Crystal Lake, IL saying they live in Chicagobut the urban sprawl that follows the Han River as it winds its way between the mountains on the northern half of the southern half of the peninsula makes everything just sort of blend in as Seoul. I live in Goyang. A suburb about an hour east-northeast from Seoul proper, situated in a district called Ilsan, on the southwestern side of the city; the side closest to the river. Nearby attractions to my apartment include Ilsan's famous (at least within Korea) Lake Park, Lafesta Shopping and Entertainment Center, and Western Dom, an open-air shopping mall, and, of course, the school. I was told early on that while the streets have names, few of them are marked, and the best way of giving directions is in relation to these attractions, and the subway stations, which Goyang has the outermost four of on the impressively convoluted Seoul subway map's orange line: Madu, Jeongbalsan, Juyeop, and Daehwa. To Seoul Station it is roughly a dollar and an hour through the tubes, or a little shorter, but more expensive, by bus or cab.

While exerting a facade of economic and urban spontaneity to the uninitiated, Ilsan emerges as a highly planned community upon closer inspection. Particularly when it comes to the massive Lake Park. The park, which at first glance looks like any ordinary park built around a lake, is actually part park, amphitheater, recreation center, and botanical garden. Features include a singing fountain with nightly light and music shows reminiscent of the massive fountain shows seen in Disney World, a cactus conservatory with the widest variety of cacti I've ever seen in one central location (and yes, I have been to Arizona), a crane cage which is, as it sounds, a large cage housing a live crane and another housing several peacocks, some of the most massive catfish I have ever seen, a plentiful garden of water lilies, an artificial waterfall, and two "folk swings," which are swings large enough to stand on suspended from about 40 feet, and nearly 5km of biking, walking, and running trails (each a separate trail to at least attempt cutting down interference among the three sports, though the attempt is somewhat futile considering small children and other less-perceptive types are somewhat oblivious or indifferent toward the distinction; as a consequence it is not at all uncommon to see cycling teams nearly miss plowing into inattentively casual bikers, children, and others who have little sense of the de facto slower-traffic-keep-right type of traffic laws) that circumnavigate the man-made lakethe largest in the peninsula. Oh, and how could I forget the outdoor exercise equipment? So, but it isn't just that these things are in Lake Park that makes it such a stand-out example of the planned cityany city could have a park with all these things in it, especially if there is a lake nearbybut rather it is that they are all so carefully and intentionally placed and organized, that after the first time around it becomes blatantly obvious that it is planned: e.g. the lake is always calm, even in the windiest of monsoon conditions, indicating that it can't be deep enough to generate wavy conditions, nor can anyone boat on the lake. Additionally, the crystal clear lake-bottom can be attributed to the lack of any natural habitat, the only fauna and flora exit in a completely engineered environment.

The key difference between this artificial or planned environment and other planned communities is that this park doesn't have any tennis or basketball courts rendered dysfunctional due to the city's need to cut the budget and willingness to sacrifice a park to save money, and it isn't new. This gargantuan outdoor recreation facilityto call it a park is really not giving it its fair shakehas been around for at least twelve years, and is easily the most awesomely and thoughtfully put together, cleanest, and well maintained piece of public land I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. The Washington Mall, Boston Commons and any of Minneapolis and St. Paul's public parks pale in comparison to Lake Park.

To wrap up what for you is, I am sure, a nauseatingly long post about a park, I'll just say that Ilsan is an unlikely place to end up on the other end of the madness that is applying to and becoming an employee of a Korean Hogwon Academy or a school in the Korean pubic education world, but so far, two weeks in, is one I am excited about, and a place I look forward to exploring as my home for the next 50 weeks of my life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The trash piles on the ground floors of apartment buildings in Korea are veritable gold mines for the visiting foreigner looking to furnish a studio-size room. Everything from kitchen supplies to living room furniture, can be easily found lying on the ground left by the latest resident to move out, into fresh digs. The Urban Crowd Effect is the force that compels people to ditch some of their larger belongings and buy (or find) new furniture to replace that which could not survive the trip. It pays dividends for foreign Hogwon teachers still awaiting their first paycheck but hoping to decorate the apartment a bit to make it feel, you know, a little like a home instead of a few blank walls, a tiny kitchen and a bathroom. While the couch we found this week may be a couch from the trash, it is still a couch. The cushions covers are washable, and the rest of it can be vacuumed; it's also not too shabby for found furniture.
<!--more-->
Goyang is far from the central city in the Seoul urban area—which near as I can tell encompasses most of the north-western corner of South Korea—and  it shares many of the properties expected from a sub- or exurban area: disproportionately upper-middle to upper-class, largely commercial, and a highly planned infrastructure. In Goyang's case this final property is not only true, but amplified to a great extent. A 2006 Newsweek article put Goyang in league with Las Vegas (one of Goyang's many sister cities), Munich, and London as one of "<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/46125/page/11" target="_blank">The Ten Most Dynamic Cities</a>" in the world. The article calls Goyang an "affluent enclave," that is (or was in 2006 before  President Lee Myung-bak took power, it's hard to discern thus far what has changed since his 2008 ascension, except that the banks of the Hangang River are still completely undeveloped, with what looks like a small buffer of farmland separating the river from the city, save for the ancient fortification built near one of its tributaries) struggling to overcome its status as a commercial-based economy filled with commuters leaving for their jobs in Seoul or other Seoul-area cities. From the little bit of reading available about this place I get the impression that while there are many bars, clubs, restaurants, and cozy coffee shops, it is the type of place Koreans would say is not a place to work, but a good place to raise a family and little else. In a word it's a suburb.

Perhaps it's the novelty of living here still not quite having worn off, but Goyang does not feel like a suburb in the way I thought of Burnsville, MN as a suburb. Much like when I was in China and told that Zhuhai was a small city comparable with Mankato, MN by Chinese standards, the sheer volume and density of people living in Goyang makes the city feel more urban by American standards than by Korean standards. For example, an <a href="http://citymayors.com/government/southkorea_government.html">urban area in South Korea</a> is a county with more than 150,000 people, and a town has 20,000 or more. In the United States, an urban area is an area formed around <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/metroareas/metroarea.html">a core urban city of at least 50,000</a>. In other words, a city like Goyang in the states with just over a million people would be in the top ten largest cities, just beating out San Jose, CA, and landing just south of Philadelphia, PA by population density. The Seoul area—housing nearly half the country's population in just 12% of its area—with 24.5 million people would be far and away the largest metropolitan area in the United States. The sheer size of this place makes it nearly impossible to compare with anyplace back home.

There is something to smaller places that is attractive. Places with a history of industrialism and natural emergence opposed to state forced growth and expansion are just more attractive. While the incredible population growth in places like Goyang and Zhuhai, China is impressive (the former growing from a small town [20,000] to the nearly 1.1 million who live here today in something like 20 years, and the latter growing by similar margins in 30 years), it is hard to really find it as interesting or compelling a history. A place like Minneapolis/St. Paul, after learning its history, really feels like it has earned every one of the 3.5 million or so people who live there, whereas here, in Goyang,  the people are here because this place was set aside, planned, or engineered, as it were, to have each of these people here.

Like any city, Goyang has local shops, small bars, cafes and locally owned dining establishments—many of which turn over weeks to months after opening, due mostly to the aggressively competitive nature of such a densely packed population's economy—it has parks, clean streets, and all the elements of a very comfortable and livable community, but for some reason all of it ends up feeling fake. It wouldn't be at all surprising if there were some kind of tax holiday for opening a café in Ilsan, or some kind of small business quota Goyang's municipal government must achieve to preserve the city's economic well-being. Even the entrepreneurship here feels fake, planned or somehow engineered. It's this lack of purpose apart from human storage that makes it difficult to really call Goyang a home in addition to a nice and comfortable place to live.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Summer vacation came and went this week and, given that we have not yet seen a pay day, we decided to explore our suburb's parent city, Seoul. We toured the Changdeok Palace in Seoul. Rich with history, it is among the most beautiful structures in all of Seoul. It brought back memories of Beijing's Forbidden City, except that, unlike Beijing which lost many historical landmarks over the years due to urban planning under the growth-at-any-costs mantra it is a city with palaces, monuments, museums and other landmarks scattered throughout, reminding visitros and Koreans of the country's long, proud history. In addition to historical significance, Seoul is also a magnificent cultural hub; a city in league with Paris, London and New York in its internationalism. Classical music, fine art, and Broadway musicals all make their way through Seoul. As we learned more about the city, and explored deeper and deeper into its nooks and crannies, we quickly realized that Seoul is probably one of the most under-appreciated cities in Asia.
<!--more-->
This got me thinking: prior to my arrival, much of what I and the people around me knew about Korea was highly inaccurate. "You'll go to work in rickshaws," said one person, "watch out, it's dangerous out there," said another. A stranger at the dentist's office offered "stay away from the border, watch out for the North. And make sure any money you make, you can get back whenever you need to," as if Korea was some kind of corrupt State that will rob you blind if you aren't careful. The HR person from our school made it seem like I should stock up on supplies. "Bring a year's supply of anything you need," I was warned, "especially deodorant."

Many people who have never been here assume that because it is a small, peninsular, country next to an Axis of Evil State, South Korea just must be some kind of developing-world nation on the fringe of getting it right and emerging from the antiquated third-world. Perhaps this is because its neighbor to the north seems hell-bent on making everyone in the world upset with them by building and testing nuclear weapons, helping rogue governments like the terrorists currently running things in Burma, and starving and manipulating its own people to keep them loyal to the <em>deus natio</em> Great Leader. Perhaps it is not a South Korea specific problem, i.e., perhaps all people equate all or most of Asia with development-in-progress because many of its largest players are still developing countries, and what development there is is concentrated in the large giants of Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo. One thing is for sure: a lot of people, in a lot of places, know very little about South Korea.

The reality is that Seoul clocks in at number 9 on <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4509&amp;page=1) " target="_blank">Foreign Policy's 2008 Global Cities Index</a> and is one of the most developed places in all of Asia. Seoul falls just short of Chicago on the aggregate, and trails all of its Asian neighbors save Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo, and surpasses all but Tokyo as the tenth best place in the world for cultural experiences. Seoul is Asia's hidden gem. It is among the safest and cleanest large cities in Asia and the world; and, with hiking among the nation's favorite past times, it is a great place for recreation of myriad variety.

All this is not to say that people who don't know about Seoul should be faulted as ignorant, or uncultured; in some ways it seems like Seoul itself is an esoteric jungle just begging you to come exploring and unlock for yourself the secrets that lie beneath its surface. The fact is that Seoul isn't like Paris or London or Los Angeles. It hasn't, for example, existed as a major economic powerhouse throughout history the way that London has; nor has it been the center of attention for filmmakers and designer fashion the way LA and Paris have for so long. The city's latest incarnation emerged decades after the Korean War and after a long, hard-fought, battle for democratic self-governance and capitalism. The Seoul visited by Americans even 30 or so years ago would look drastically different than the one standing before us today. It probably would not have a Renoir exhibit in one of its many art museums, nor would have internationally acclaimed theatrical performances rotating through its stages, professional baseball teams, two of the largest and most well known electronics companies in the world (Samsung and LG), and one of the world's largest automobile groups (Hyundai/Kia Motor Group). What was not long ago a developing city attempting to find its place in its own region, is now a major hub of economic and cultural activity becoming increasingly impossible to ignore.

So but again, all of this growth is incredibly recent which, combined with the reality that when Korea shows up on the major news networks back home it's usually prefixed with the word "North," means that to anyone who is not really on the ball, Seoul is probably just another city in Asia. Anyone up for the adventure will discover a hidden gem; a diamond in the rough.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On: The Hogwon</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most people outside of Korea might guess that the word "<em>Hogwon</em>" is the Korean word for a hog farm or the name of some kind of hog-based commodity. I'll admit I didn't have a clue about what a <em>Hogwon</em> was until I started working for one. Even now that I am working for one, I still do not really know how to describe it, because there isn't really anything like it back home. The closest thing to it is probably a learning center like Sylvan, but even that isn't really the education model that can describe a <em>Hogwon</em>.
<!--more-->
The most basic way to describe it is to say it is an academy designed to augment the education received in public schools. They usually have a specific focus like English (probably the most popular) or Theater, Guitar, Piano, etc., and are private businesses that charge a premium for their services. The school I work for is one of the oldest and largest <em>Hogwons</em>. They serve primarily returnee students, i.e., students who have lived abroad in an English speaking country for a significant period of time, and students possessing a high aptitude in speaking, reading and writing in English. They only hire foreign teachers with English as a native language, or who have developed English skills comparable to a native level. That is to say, none of the teachers at my school passed or even took a Test Of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).

The key difference between a <em>Hogwon</em> and a place like Sylvan back home is that whereas Sylvan proudly brands itself a center providing a "tutoring service," <em>Hogwons</em> are proudly branded  as schools (or academies). <em>Hogwons</em> are not parochial, they are not non-profit educational institutions; they are businesses, and the parents are customers buying a product called a well-educated student.

As a business they must have consistent, measurable, and demonstrable proof of their product's quality. Thus, since their product is education, they must have some way of proving that they are better than their competition and that they are in fact improving their students' abilities to read, write, and speak English. They do this the way that some people believe is the way we ought to be measuring our teachers' performance back home: through comprehensive and repeated standardized testing, tracking, and leveling. Teachers at <em>Hogwons</em> like the one I work for are evaluated on their students' performance on monthly tests and regular, standardized, tracking tests. Administrators are concerned primarily with meeting the parent's expectations, and continually proving that all the students are improving, even if some of them are not.

This attitude puts the teachers in a peculiar quandary, and one that makes me appreciate the work of Education Minnesota and other teacher's unions back home more than ever. As an Alien Resident teaching for a school that places the parent's dollar as their top priority, it is often difficult to achieve any kind of vocational or career goal toward being a good teacher, or even hold myself to the standards I would hold myself to if I were a teacher back home.

This week we were asked by our supervisor to review the vocabulary content on one of the tracking testsThese are the regular tests used to determine at what level a student is reading and what class they should be placed in to learn with other students at their level. administered by the school for 40 minutes directly before administering the test, to some of the classes that the administration deemed need to move to a higher track. The motivation for this request came as a result of apparently needing to appease the parents who are skeptical of our school's abilities. Thus reigning in one of the many criticisms of tracking policy back home: the tracking becomes (or always is) somewhat arbitrary. Tracking students into specific classrooms, particularly when that tracking is guided by income potential and a customer-is-always-right-or-at-the-very-least-should-always-be-pleased philosophy, ignores the students' innate ability to learn, and the fact that one group of students may start learning at the same rate, but the group's homogeneity quickly decays as the students begin learning at different rates. That is, students A through G may all be at the same position right now, but students A and E learn quicker than students B-D who also learn at different rates than F-G, and eventually these students are stratified as heterogeneously as a non-tracked classroom.

Many of the critiques of tracking are highlighted at my <em>Hogwon</em>. The upper and lower classes on the tracking strata are stigmatized by, at least, some of the teachers. Once upon a time there was a group of fifth graders reading at a third grade level who were pejoratively nicknamed "The Wizards" by some of the teachers (some of whom were teaching The Wizards) at the school, and assumed to be dumber than the fourth-graders and the rest of the fifth-graders. If these students were interspersed throughout the school's other classrooms they would not carry the chagrin-laden badge of shame and disdain they carried while students here.

Another critique of tracking systems illuminated in the <em>Hogwon</em> system relates to the effort of students in upper and lower tracks. At my <em>Hogwon</em> the students in the highest levels of their grade's track are not as apt to put extraordinary effort into their work because they've already achieved as much as possible for their grade, and many of the lower level students do not put as much effort into their work because reaching the highest level seems like such a disparate challenge they have not hope of ever achieving.

In addition to being essentially asked to go over the answer key with our students before the test so that they could track up, I also learned this week (and this did not surprise me given the aforementioned business model) that the school is also reluctant to track students down. When the teachers bring forth a criticism of the system, and ask, for example that the school stop pandering to the parents and let the tracking system work so that the teachers can actually teach to the quasi-homogeneous classroom they are supposedly teaching, they are met with a response that essentially says the teachers aren't important, and what is important is that the school maintain its reputation with the parents, and continue meeting quarterly profit goals. That is, the teachers clock in at second to third on the school's list of priorities after their ability to take in the requisite cash for the month.
Some people say there is no such thing as non-profit education, just as some people say there is no such thing as a non-profit organization in a market-driven economy. But the difference between non-profit and "business" education is clear after working for the latter, and being educated by the former. The latter is driven by profit first, which often means following the cheaper policy or the one that is better able produce tangible, repeatable results of product reliability. Non-profit education values the contribution teachers make to the organization, and would have the stones to stand up for their teachers in the face of a parent threatening to take their student to another school.

This is not to say that non-profit education is not concerned about enrollment, rather, that enrollment might be among the institutions priorities, and that a non-profit institution's strategies for improving enrollment might be approached more holistically, rather than focused on consistent and incremental increases on a set of standardized tests. A non-profit version of a <em>Hogwon</em> might brag, for example, about the number of students who go on to study at boarding schools abroad or end up studying at a university in the US or Canada, or the number of students who go on to use their English in some applicable way that really demonstrates the quality of education they are getting. They would have to use the virtues of the system as evidence of its success instead of a steadily increasing trend-line created from data gathered through aggregated test scores.

With all this in mind, it is not surprising that these schools have high faculty turnover rates. Not only are many of the teachers coming from overseas, living thousands of miles from their home and native culture to teach English as Alien residents, those who are looking to make a career out of teaching would probably find their pursuit greatly stifling. A <em>Hogwon</em> like mine dictates a teaching style, a curriculum, and nearly everything short of a daily lesson plan, and performance is measured by the customer's assessment of whether their child has sufficiently memorized enough vocabulary words. Not necessarily a measure of success in my eyes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Part One:</em>
MOULARD PUZZLE CAFE, ILSAN -- I am seated outside piecing together the last of the Starry Night puzzle's frame. A puzzle cafe is exactly as it sounds, a cafe where you may sip a coffee of something a bit stiffer while assembling a myriad variety of puzzles. The drinks are mediocre, though the beer is at least well priced, but the real draw are the puzzles.I excuse myself to the bathroom and let Danielle try to go it alone in figuring out how to interpret the Thousand Pieces of VanGogh sitting on our table.
<!--more-->

When I returned she remarked on an event unfolding across the street. "I think there is a drunken businessman in that cab who is refusing to get out," she said directing my attention, ever so discretely, toward the cab parked across the street in front of Home Plus--the mega-store that's like a five-plus-story Super Target.

"Oh yeah?"

"Yeah, he keeps leaning into his cab and yelling at whoever is in the back seat," she said referring to the cab driver who, looking rather distressed to say the least, was at that moment gazing skyward with his hands on his forehead, as if to show the busy street of spectators and passers-by that he was dealing with some kind of uncivilized or immature child. It's not even 10:00 on a Friday, and already resembles a scene in which most people would expect only the most unruly of frat-boys would partake; but this is not a frat boy, this was likely a middle aged, family man, probably dressed with a coat and tie.<em></em>

<em>Part Two:</em>
EARLIER THAT WEEK ALONG WHAT-COULD-BE-ANY-MAJOR-ROAD, ILSANWe were walking home after a long day at work and decided to stop at an Italian place called Pomodoro, about a quarter of the way home. When we left we could see, on the side of the road just beyond the restaurant, a taxi cab with two men standing nearby. The cab's door was open, and as we approached, we could hear the men's voices and could begin making out their body language. They are into something pretty heated and we can almost smell the alcohol on their breath as we pass them by. It's just after sundown on a weekday.<em></em>

<em>Part Three:</em>
LAFESTA SHOPPING CENTER, ILSANOn a stroll about the shopping center we spot a man using his blue blazer for a blanket and briefcase for a pillow, sound asleep under a park bench. He was maybe homeless, as least temporarily, but chances were he had been sleeping there since early that morning. It's before 10:00am on a weekday.<em></em>

<em>Part Four:</em>
SEOUL METRO TRANSIT, SUBWAY LINE THREE: SOMEWHERE BETWEEN GUPABAL AND SAMSON STATIONS, ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE TRAIN'S START AND ITS ENDWe boarded the train at Gupabalthere isn't anything particularly intersting at Gupabal, or if there is we haven't found it yet, but half of the line 3 trains go as far as Gupabal while the other half take us home to Juyeop Stationand situated in the seats at the train car's fore that are reserved for the handicapped, expectant and elderly was one of the finer of Seoul's honest and hard-working bread-winners, unbelievably and belligerently intoxicated and presumably heading home. Standing near him a manolder than the Suit but not a geriatricwearing a red shirt, and his companion heckle the wetsuit on their way out of the train, the man in red making what sounded like a coughing noise; the kind someone makes to disguise them saying "jackass" or some other obscenity. The drunk gentleman shouted something followed by the Korean equivalent of "the bird." It's unclear what exactly was said, but something the intoxicated exchanged with the elderly man across the aisle from him set off a shouting match that quickly turned violent.

The elder of the two, a retiree heading home after a hike, merely trying to defend himself, was wearing a light blue hiking tunic and boots, and looked in far better condition to be throwing down, as it were, than the man attacking him. The disputed appeared, at least in part, to revolve around a fanone of those paper ones that sort of accordions outand was, at various times, used to bait the now vicious drunk into the adjoining car.

Eventually a good Samaritan intervened, after the kicking began, and attempted to diffuse the situation. And, while this more strapping and a bit taller man did manage to keep the menace detained, as soon as he went back to his seat the assailant returned. The geriatric lept to his feet and used his full weight to keep the door closed while the attacker kicked fiercely at the door; kicking, as if by some stroke of magic, a subway door could be kicked in like a criminal's apartment's door in a cheezy crime film. At some point at one of the subway stops, the old woman who was sitting nearest the elderly adventurer got off the train, whether it was because of the unfolding scene or not was unclear; the woman sitting across the aisle from her, nearest the action, remained seated. Just after the hiker got up to hold the door shut, he opened it just enough that his opponent could squeeze a hand through, and as soon as the assaulting hand had breached the doorway, he slammed the door on it. A short while later he grabbed the inebriated by the tie, threw him to the seat he had previously occupied, and put him in a choke-hold, at which point the younger man again intervened by separating the geriatric and exiling the drunk to the train-car-turned-holding-cell from whence he came.
A blind panhandler walked through and the woman seated next to us gave him a 500 won coin. There was no way he could have known about the brawling 50+ crowd between whom he had briefly called a cease-fire.

After a short calmeven the lowest scum-bag wouldn't continue the brawl while the blind man moved aboutthe attacker, held off by the younger man, got to his feet and showed his now bloody hand to the other passengers-turned-spectators among us and, before he began smearing his blood on the door's window, belted out the most uncivilized and pre-pubescent battle cry I've heard outside of my classroom.

Eventually the middle aged hiker held the bloody-handed assailant in his cell and motioned for the geriatric to grab the emergency call microphone to summon the authoritiessomething he was threatening at various stages of the conflict. After the call the three of them somehow communicated that they would be getting off at the next stop, the middle-aged-guardian-of-us-all as their escort and mediator.
<p style="text-align: center;">*     *        *</p>

It's worth noting that for every example of dipso-maniacal behavior or crapulence we have seen there are at least as many, if not several fold more, examples of the men here being truly respenctable citizens, parents, and gentlemanly, but the fact remains that public drunkenness is rampant and often rude, obnoxious, or violent. Regardless of the day of the week, venue, or audience, it is common to see men dressed in casual to formal business attirecomplete with shiny pants and sequined tiesthree-, four-, or five-sheets-to-the-wind often roaming the galbi restaurants and bars in our exurban neighborhood in packs before heading home, smelling of soju and beer, and passing out without so much as seeing their children until the next morning.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We left Goyang immediately after work bound to Jinwi station where we were promised a farming experience. So began our farming experience: three hours on public transportation, two backpacks, a couple of sweatshirts and some basic supplies, a guy named William and the promise of a "once in a lifetime experience" somewhere on the outskirts of Seoul; the ones exactly opposite from the outskirts in which we presently reside, to be exact.<!--more-->

<em>26 September 2009, Morning</em>

Some people wake up looking terrified of their surroundings, as if to say, "where am I and what are all these strange people about to do to me," others wake up confused and perplexed with a look asking for help, as if they are no longer sure where they are or how they got there, in the broadest sense. These people look out the windo in pursuit of a horizon they can focus on to cure their slumber-induced spatial disorientation. Regardless of how any of us <em>wanted</em> to wake up, we were all foced to roll up our sleeping bags and blankets at 7:00 when one of the Korean organizers walked through with some kind of K-Pop tune blaring from his cell phone, which brings us to the final class of sleepers: the holdout. These people will do anything thing in their power to squeeze every last moment of sleep from their nights. Here on the farm there are no pleasantries for these people, no merciful nudging and prodding, no whispering, "wake up...wake up..." in their ears, in stead these folks are greeted by their new best friend who jumps on top of them, seizes their body and shouts "WAKE UP" loud enough to hopefully wake up the other holdouts, violently shaking them.

Breakfast was cereal and rice with kimchi (??) soup. Across the room hung a sign telling us our schedule for the day. Breakfast ran until 8 today. Nearby one of the louder of us foreigners is trying to explain that it wasn't because he was so drunk last night that he couldn't remember any of our names, but that he never remembers names, he remembers stories, places, he says. He could just say he didn't bother to remember our names because he didn't care who you are, only what story you can add to his vault.

<em>Becoming Farmers9:45 A.M.</em>

I was surrounded by members of a nameless family. The father was filling a vat resembling a planter large enough to house a corpse flower with some variety of insecticide. To my left were rows of crops covered by large plastic tarps to create a greenourse with some kind of intricate irrigation system running through it. The father fired up a hard-cart sprayer and walked it backward through the crops, the tank held just enough insecticide for one pass. The wife of the family spotted the back of my shirt: makguli, it read, a Korean rice wine that is cloudy like milk tea but also sweet. They chattered some in Korean and all I could understand was makguli, over and over until Sunone of the Korean workers in our group of four. I said I thought 9:45 in the morning was a little early for a glass of wine, but quickly realized I had no choice when she brought out a tea kettle full of some high quality, homemade, makguli, which apparently doesn't give you a headache in the morning.

The day consisted of tearing wees from a spiach patch in amongst the most diverse acreage of farmland I've ever seen. On the jaunt from the greenhouse where we had <em>secham,</em> (pronounced: Say-CHam) a break in the farming day between breakfast and lunch, to the field we were tending we saw sesame, squash and chili peppers; the patch next to ours grew cucumbers vertically up poles stretching to the top of the canopy, and a small patch of corn sprang up near the end of the field. We also experienced first-hand that family farms can and do feed themselves on the crops they grow. When we left for lunch we were given a box, a little bigger than a paper box, filled with cucumbers to give to our Wooriwa crew.

<em>P.M.</em>

The afternoon hours ticked by with rapid speed. After a filling boxed lunch and fresh cucumbers with red bean and pepper paste, and the morning <em>seacham</em>, we were far from hungry when we the afternoon <em>secham</em> came along. We conquered nearly the entire 200 meters of crops with graceful agility.

The farm family offered up his shower as a token of appreciation for our work when we finished a long day of tiring dirty work. I was told by Sun that much like in the US, Koreans have taken to preferring to insource migrant workers, in this case from Thailand, to do the "dirty" jobs most Koreans don't want. This is the extent of my knowledge of Korean agriculture issues.

Dinner was a feast of Korean food featuring one of my favorites, <em>pajeon</em>Korean seafood pancakesand pork served with rice and, of course, kimchi. Before leaving the farm I asked Jin, the other Korean in our G4, about how kimchi pots are used. Kimchi pots are large terra cotta drums in which Korean families store their kimchi. Traditionally, Jin explained, kimchi pots were filled during the summer and autumn months with enough kimchi to last through the winter. It has nothing to do with the fermentation process, as I previously understood, rather it was simply a traditional means of keeping the staple of all cuisine fresh and cold throughout the winter. During dinner we were finally, formally introduced to Wooriwa.

A word in Korean that means "we all come together," Wooriwa is an organization of university students who come together to learn and experience the finer points of Korean culture and multiculturalism. In this trip's case, the goal or mission was to do a public service related to the long standing cultural pillar that there is one Korea and that all Koreans are a singular nation, a single people.

Korean farmers are apparently facing some hard times and whether by university edict or otherwise, these students made this trip in part, out of civic duity. The Koreans seem to believe quit strongly in the adage, "we all do better when we all do better," and these students were here help.

<em>So long, and Thanks for all the Makguli</em>

We arose after a night of drinking Makguli and meeting new friends from all over Korea and the globe, and greeted the day with a fresh sense of what it meant to be here, working the land for Koreans, and a readiness to dive head-first, into another day of agriculture.

Today our project was helping a zuchini farmer excise the invading weeds from his field. Armed with handheld hoes, Danielle and I were two foreigners in a triad with a Korean student. We left for the farm around 9:00. The weeds today were a little more sparse and remarkably easier to pull thanks, in part, to our tools. The conversation revolved around our newest friend, Benny.

His English name, of course, Benny spent a year of his high school career in Chico, CA where he had what may have been a quintessentially American experience. He tried out and made the varsity football team at his high school and revived its soccer team almost by himself. He met Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger at the California State Capitol, asked a girl to the prom, and visited SanFrancisco and Disneyland.

After returning from the U.S., he went to a university for a year before enlisting in the Korean military. In Korea, he told us, you're either drafted into the army, or you may enlist in another of Korea's armed forces. He chose the latter and paid his dues with a year in the Korea Coast Guard where he protected the Korean shores from all manner of trouble including helping clean up efforts during the <a title="2008 Korea Oil Spill" href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2007/12/113_15224.html">2008 oil spill off the peninsula's coast.</a>

Our farmer told us to not work too hard, and was greatful that we were there. He was a bit upset that we had to leave so soon because he wanted to show us more of his farm and let us prune some tomato plants. I have to say that while I was sore to my core and really was looking forward to falling asleep in my own bed, I found myself trying to think of ways in which we could stay. When we got back to the base camp-like building we were all sleeping in, I noticed the posters with all our names had been taken down and I realized that it was time to go. This amazing experience I will never forget, was coming to an end.

After eating a quick lunch we all packed our things, collected some email addresses and gathered together for a group picture. The final item on the schedule posted in the main room read "C U AGAIN!!" and I think we were all hoping to hold ourselves to that commitment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month was my first with a new batch of students and classes. I am now teaching all the elementary grades we have at our hogwon. I teach a different subject to each of my classes and it is only a little frustrating.

<!--more-->I teach two classes for each grade. First and second grade each have about 20 students across two classes and come once a day. I see each student for forty minutes a day which works out to about 280 minutes each week. We're supposed to evaluate our students on their behavior and academic performance, but that is incredibly hard to do given this time constraint. Its hard to find something that works for their teaching style or to control their behavior when they leave as soon as I figure something out. There are many days I when I think I have a home run lesson plan and it totally backfires because, a little over a month and a half into this semester, I still barely know anything about these kids and how they learn.

This week headquarters handed down our writing lesson plan. For fifth grade I was supposed to answer some reading comprehension questions related to a short article about the Vietnam Memorial's designer, teach them the continuous past tense (the one where you talk about things that happened while you were doing something else), and brainstorm and prewrite for a personal narrative exercise. Each of those parts alone could have made for a perfectly good 40 minute lesson plan for ELL fifth graders but because my fifth graders only have writing once each week, I had to condense it down.

This kind of thing happens with a lot of my classes. It seems like I always have either far too much to cover, or not nearly enough for a day, and these parts are where I have to get creative and find quick ways of teaching very complicated things, or find ways to stretch out otherwise easy things for a longer time. I'm not sure what my co-workers are up to because many of them seem dumbfounded by the amount of prep work I do for my classes, and often remark on the effort I put in to each lesson. I'm just not sure how else to do it. Our school has a surprising lack of resources for us: we have no crayons, markers, poster paper, or other art supplies at our disposal; if we want to do something where our students have to color, we have provide these for ourselves.

It isn't because our school cannot afford these things, we teach some of Korea's most upwardly mobile families who all pay a hefty premium for their kids to learn here, rather it is because it's simply not in the business model to provide these things for the teachers. According to HQ there are plenty of resources at our disposal to teach what needs to be taught. Anything else is an unnecessary luxury.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cafe Pascucci is one of the few places open today. A big corporate chain, Pascucci is a cozy cafe in LaFesta catering to the Western tastes many Koreans have for coffee and cafe sandwiches. It stays open for the same reason many big corporate chains stay open during major holidays back home.
<!--more-->
Chuseok is the Korean equivalent of Thanksgiving, and today Koreans from every corner of the peninsula are spending their time with family. The streets, normally dangerously packed with cars and scooters are today strangely silent. The only traffic today is from people visiting their ancestors at their eternal resting places.

For many the holiday began with a day off of work and school to travel and safely arrive at the oldest granparent's home in time for the day's festivities. As for us, we enjoyed a day apart from the students, administrators, and other teachers who routinely populate our day to day lives as the characters of our Korean drama, by venturing to the summit of Bukahnsan National Park's Bagundae Peak.

At 836 meters (about 2,700 feet) the peak is the highest in the park, but less than half the height of South Korea's tenth highest peak. It's an impressive sight to see from the ground, and even more so the other way around.

Our climbing team consisted of Danielle and I, along with two new friends, Andre and Anna (who are blogging over at <a title="Seoulful Adventures" href="http://seoulfuladventures.wordpress.com/">Seoulful Adventures</a>). Andre is a Minneapolis transplant hailing from the Lake Harriet area and Anna is a native of the D.C. area exurbs in Virginia. Like us they just graduated from college, Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, to be precise) this past June. Together the four of us scaled Bagudae along with dozens of far more ambitious Korean hikers of all ages. While it was hard to see men and women who were probably not much younger than my gradnma pass us as though we were standing still, there was also some sense of appreciation I could feel from some of them. It was as if some people were glad to see us participating in the great Korean pasttime on the day before the most important holiday in Korean culture and not stimbling around Itaewon drunk as skunks at 3:00 in the afternoon, as many foreigners are wont to do.

The climb itself was unlike any hike I've ever before attempted. Instead of long winding switchbacks, Bagudae was almost straight up the hill, at some points using stairs or near ladders, but often the trail was just a pile of well placed rocks and trees to show you the best way to the top.

The summit itself was a solid rock face, a peak most hikes would go around or otherwise admire without scaling. Getting to the top meant strategically stepping in just the right spot while holding on to a thick cable set up to show you the way, and give you something to hold on to while walking. Even though it was a painfully difficult climb, the view from the top was unbelievable.

We talk about the Seoul urban sprawl a lot: the three hour subway rides, tiny crowded spaces, and alarmingly high population; but it wasn't until standing atop this boulder perched sky high above the city that I really could appreciate the city's real vastness. The land stretches well beyond the horizon to the south, an endless sea of sky scrapers and high rise apartment, many of which look nearly identical from this vantage. The sprawl continues to the east and the west, occasionally interrupted only by the mountains and the Han. To the North was an abyss of emptiness, an expanse of uninhabited mountains outlining a jagged horizon.

A few weeks ago, North Korea announced they would be allowing families to reunite with their loved ones, if briefly, across the 38th Parallel, and the English language news has occasionally reported on planned first-ever reunions between married couples who haven't seen each other in 60 years, for example. While it is difficult to imagine a reunification happening anytime soon, the borderless vista as seen from the highest point in the Seoul area evoked a powerful sense of hope that one day my students who speak so passionately about the belief in "one Korea," may see it happen.

For the rest of our Chuseok holiday we were hoping to find something fascinating in the Hongdae area and spending a rare quiet day in Seoul. We ended up finding a quaint little cafe on the outskirts of the district that was filled with vintage Americana. The coffee bar was constructed inside of an old VW bus, and books and trinkets of things related to the US or Volkswagens (odd considering that VW is not an American company) adorned the walls and panels of the bus and the cafe.

Happy Chuseok, everyone.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From time to time we shake things up and make our site a little more user-friendly or change the way we deliver you content. In the beginning we wanted to bring some fancy-looking, podcastable, and printer-friendly versions of each of our posts, and then we ran into some problems with our publishing software deciding to go out to lunch. We also added a photos page with slide shows from each of our picasa pages serving up our most recent pictures from our journey around the Korean peninsula, and recently installed a gadget to allow our mobile users better access to our page. Today we rearranged our links so that their a little more organized and it's easier for your to find the links you are looking for and know what kind of site you are visiting when you click on one of them.<!--more-->

Instead of having a giant and unhelpful "friends" category, and a few smaller categories for everyone and everything else, we now have more categories with fewer links in each. Here's what to expect from each category:
<ul>
	<li>Expat blogs: these are blogs from other expats living and teaching English in Korea, some of them are by people we know, some are not.</li>
	<li>Family: this category is reserved for blood relatives of either author, pretty self explanatory.</li>
	<li>Food: a category for people writing about food in Korea, or other places around the world.</li>
	<li>Gustavus: all links here end in gustavus.edu.</li>
	<li>Public Radio: these are links to radio stations that are non-profit and listener supported or our favorite programs run by those stations.</li>
	<li>Teach For America: many of our friends from the Class of '09 went on to teach for this wonderful organization, you can read about their experiences here.</li>
</ul>
For the most part these are all mutually exclusive. Where that is not true, we placed the site in the category that best reflected its content.

We also changed the way we file our stories to make it easier for our readers to find the posts they want. All posts about Korea are filed under the "<a title="Stories from Korea" href="http://harmsboone.org/category/korea/">Stories from Korea</a>" category, and anything shorter than 500 words (or about a page) is also filed under "<a title="shorts" href="http://harmsboone.org/category/shorts/">Shorts</a>." From time to time we will write longer pieces that will range from 800-1,400 words and we will file them as "<a href="http://harmsboone.org/category/features/">Features</a>." These posts are not only longer, but are also more in depth and finely tuned than other posts. The final category under which you will see stories filed is "<a title="Admin Category" href="http://harmsboone.org/category/admin/">Admin</a>" and will include posts like this about site maintenance and any changes we make.

In addition to categorizing our posts, we are also tagging each post with keywords that describe a post's content. Near the bottom of the sidebar on the left side of the page is something called a tag cloud that shows the most popular tags for our posts. The bigger the keyword is, the more we've blogged about it.

Hopefully these changes will help you navigate this site a bit better. We'll new posts about Korea are coming soon; in the mean time, keep your feed reader pointed here!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It writhed around for a bit in the small plastic bowl before finally dying, the way any animal might after having its head impaled and skin removed. Without hardly flinching the man grabbed another hagfish from the pile, removed the awl-like tool from the cutting board and drove it through the fish's head as if to say, "hold still, this will only hurt a little." Nearby a row of old women, <em>ajummas</em>, were splitting clams with a knife.

Welcome to a routine day at Busan's famous Jagalchi Fish Market.<!--more-->

The market itself is contained within a large glass building on the harbor, but the fish trading kiosks sprawl for several blocks on either side of the imposing (<a title="Jagalchi Market feels the tides of Change - Korea.net" href="http://www.korea.net/news/News/newsView.asp?serial_no=20070716016&amp;part=112&amp;SearchDay=" target="_blank">and brand, spanking new</a>) centerpiece, and about a block or two inland. Right outside the entrance is another man wearing a rubber apron and waders wrangling octopi pulled live from a bucket of saltwater. He takes the animal by its tentacles and lets it suck on his knee while he pulls the guts from its bulbous body (the whole scene gives a renewed meaning to the Captain Beefheart lyrics about mollusks  being both fast and bulbous), peeling the Octopus from his knee and throwing the remaining body into a separate container before going back for more.

Inside the market are fishmongers selling just about every imaginable variety of seafood out of impressively enormous live tanks. Those who think Red Lobster smells bad would take care to brace themselves for what might be the worst smelling place they've ever encountered. Everything from conch to sea bream is living its last few moments in these tanks before being served sashimi style: raw, at one of the nearby restaurants.
It's possible to spend hours getting lost in the labyrinth of live tanks and marveling at the cascading sea water spilling over three or four tanks before spilling onto the floor, but a the sashimi restaurants on the second floor is an imperative final stop. The women running these restaurants rush toward visitors with rolled up menus, unrolling them as they walk, showing the different fish you can eat in their kitchen-free diners and prices WallMart would surely envy.

For those who have an aversion to all-out raw fish there is another option: mostly raw and freshly cooked seafood. To be more precise, it is possible to get cooked food, but it will likely be cooked right in front of you, and may be alive until moments before gracing your palate. For example, consider the shrimp.

Those who have never seen a shrimp removed from the cocktail probably don't know that shrimp have minuscule legs when in the shell, rather like tiny lobsters sans claws, and look like they're running a marathon with really small steps around the live tank. At this particular establishment shrimp are not served scampi, coconut, grilled, sautéd, chilled, cocktail or any of the myriad other preparations detailed by Bubba back in '94; no, here you have but one option.

Before bringing the shrimps, the server brought a plate of tiny conch shells and proceeded to demonstrate the process of removing the morsel of meat from the shell with a toothpick. These were, in case you were unsure, raw and tasted very much like the inside of Jagalchi smelled. This blogger went back for seconds, but not thirds.

Moments later she returned and placed a shallow pot atop the camp-stove like device, lined it with foil, and filled it with a generous layer of salt. As one of my professors would say, remember this because it will be important soon. Then she brings out a baker's dozen shrimp in her arms, removes the lid from the pan and throws them, alive, into the salt where they thrash about for a few minutes like popcorn on a stove-top popper. The server removed the lid, the shrimps jumped a little more and she turned off the heat. Lunch was served.

It's hard to imagine shrimp tasting better than these oil-free, self-seasoned crustaceans we just watched perish beneath the cover of a pan and a butane flame.

The PETA types and even those less militantly concerned with animal rights may find this a bit disturbing, abusive, and a whole host of other adjectives including, possibly, murderous. But what else can I say except that it was delicious, satisfying, and above all else cheap, clean and probably healthier than any of the pre-killed seafood I fed myself while employed by Red Lobster for two and a half years; not to mention damn tastier. For many, the thought of an animal scampering around in a cauldron of salt until the moment it dies and immediately thereafter feasting upon its body is something that should happen only in the abstract. The reality of cuisine is brutally different, however, and seeing things like the spectacle of Jagalchi really drives home the challenge any good gourmet should confront. The challenge has moral and philosophical implications that should perhaps be left to the pros to ponder, but to the casual diner who will eat the hamburger but refuses to eat veal because it is from a baby cow, or the seafood lover who will not cook up a Maine lobster because of the caustic commotion created by the clang of a lobster swimming to its death in a pot of boiling water, yet has no qualms with the king crab or shrimp scampi, it is a necessary and humbling one to endure. The focal point of it is to force the line of questioning similar to the one forced by David Foster Wallace in his famous 2004 essay, "<a title="Consider the Lobster" href="http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2004/08/consider_the_lobster" target="_blank">Consider the Lobster</a>" (published first in Gourmet [RIP]), which he ends by asking rhetorically:
<blockquote>"After all, isn't being extra aware and attentive and thoughtful about one's food and it's overall context what distinguishes a real gourmet? Or is all the gourmet's extra attention and sensibility just supposed to be aesthetic, gustatory?"</blockquote>
That is to say, that those of us who proclaim our love for food: the slow foodies, the fast foodies, the green, sustainable, or experimental foodies should not only focus our attention to food awareness in only one direction but ignore or dismiss places like Jagalchi  out of hand. To ignore that regardless of whether the cow was a calf or an adult when it was served to you, the slaughterhouse saw it first; or that regardless of whether it was alive and kicking seconds or days before it was cooked and served, it was at some point killed by a human, and if Jagalchi is anything like other fish markets,  in a public exhibition. To ignore this is to commit an egregious straw man by picking apart the flaws of the overwhelming majority of people who are decidedly <em>not</em> foodies with an air of sophistication and arrogant condescension, and all out ignoring the flaws of their own argument. The harsh and brutal reality that everyone who claims or is ascribed the title of <em>foodie</em> should confront is that your food is killed, sometimes brutally. Call it murder, cruelty, or whatever you want, but, as the old saw goes, don't knock it until you have seen it and tried it. Go to Jagalchi and watch the shrimp battle the salt, eat it, savor it, enjoy it, and if at the end of the day you feel like a criminal, you win.

As for me, would I do it again? You had better believe it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lee Kyong-hee, 62, tells the story about being reunited, if briefly, with a sister she hasn't seen since being separated at the end of the Korean War nearly 60 years ago. Lee, her mother (now 100 years old), and other siblings met with their long lost sister at Mount Kumgang in North Korea over the Chuseok holiday.
<blockquote>We had five reunion sessions in total, spending two hours with my sister each time, in addition to a one-hour farewell meeting.

The moment Hye-gyong entered the reunion hall I recognised her immediately even though she looks very different from what I remember about her appearance.

She was 16 years old when I last saw her; she is now 75.</blockquote>
The<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8310352.stm"> BBC</a> has her story, and her reflections on the intra-peninsular relationship between the two Koreas and what will need to happen in order for a peaceful reunion to occur:
<blockquote>In helping North Korea I believe the South Korean government shouldn't expect the situation to change overnight.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Two WordPress Plugins</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've had some time recently to develop a couple of WordPress plugins. They're my first real plugins, I've built some functionality into custom themes I developed that could be spun off into plugins, but other people eventually built those better than I would have, or I built them so specifically tied into the theme that spinning them into plugins would have been more work than they're worth. That said, I'm pretty proud of these plugins in that they solve some key problems I've been dealing with for a while.</p>

<p>The first plugin is called Double Return and the problem it solves is one related to a mismatch in the way most people write in Microsoft Word and the way most developers write WP Themes. When people write, they use the return key to add a new line. If they want space between paragraphs, they add a second return. In HTML this looks like:</p>

<pre>
<p>Some text in a paragraph.</p>
<p>Some text in another paragraph.</p>
</pre>

		<title>Comparing to home: Seoul Metro v. WMATA</title>
		<link>http://www.harmsboone.org/?p=1695</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friends of mine and family have likely heard me extoll WMATA's faults in an unfair comparison to Seoul. The Farragut stations should definitely be one station with an underground walkway, for example, or the cars should have electronic maps that show you where you are and in which direction you're headed above the doors. And while there is a long list of things WMATA could learn from Seoul, it nonetheless still has a few tags going for it.

<strong>SmarTrip vs. T-money</strong>
While tied for dumbest name for a transit card, the two cards have many differences. At their basic level they are the same: they are reloadable metro tickets that are cheaper than buying a paper ticket. You have to buy both (unlike other cities where the card is free, Boston) and reloading them is a fairly straightforward transaction in the metro stations. Both cards are also interoperable with other cities, in DC you can ride a network of suburban transit and Baltimore buses with SmarTrip. In Korea your T-money card works throughout the country and can even be used for some commuter trains similar to the VRE or MARC.

In DC, these cards can be purchased at (almost?) every metro station along with <a href="http://www.wmata.com/fares/purchase/where.cfm">a bunch of retail locations.</a> The machines that sell them are designed in possibly the least user friendly manner, but they exist and you can use a debit or credit card to pay for them. You can also use a card to pay for your SmarTrip refill. Not the case in Seoul. A few stations have them for purchase, but for the most part you have to find a convenience store that carries them, and Despite the machines looking far nicer and being perhaps a bit more user friendly, you have to pay cash to reload your T-money card. This is a huge pain in a country where cards are accepted almost everywhere.

The two systems also differ in what your card can be used to purchase. On WMATA, the card is good on trains and busses only. In Seoul, however, the card is a transit debit card that operates on RFID. It can be used at some convenience stores and even in Taxi cabs.

Metro card convenience winner: WMATA

<strong>Broken escalators vs. Stairs</strong>
When I first moved to DC I was confused by how such a developed metro system could have so many broken escalators. I was living in Rosslyn at the time and all but one escalator was broken almost every time I rode the orange line. Similarly with almost every stop in DC and especially it seemed at transfer stations the escalators were out. Even newly replaced escalators like Dupont Circle seemed to be out of order often. Combine that with broken and slow elevators and getting underground in DC can mean a lot of steps. I didn't remember so many escalators being out of service in Seoul, and I now realize that is because there are far fewer escalators per station in the metro system here. Metro stations have more entrances and it seems they are usually accessed by sometimes very narrow steps. One or two entrances will have an escalator going one direction or the other, and there's usually one elevator. But the stations here are much larger than DC stations. The hongdae station, which now includes a transfer to the airport train, has nine exits in a six block radius and only one elevator. Unless you happen to be near one of the escalators, you're probably walking anyway.

Accessibility winner: soft win for WMATA, if only because of the broken elevator shuttles.

<strong>Small vs. Large stations</strong>
I've often marveled at how ridiculous it is that in DC Farragut North and West are two stations serving three lines rather than one. They're so close together! How hard could it be to build a little transfer tunnel under Farragut Square? Okay, probably kind of a big task, but still! It's a free transfer but you have to walk all the way up above ground to make it. What gives? Chinatown and Metro Center could probably be combined into one underground mega-station that would make it possible to transfer from one line to any other line on the system from the same spot downtown. 

In Seoul that is definitely the case. Take a look at the Jongno 3-ga station on Seoul. There are three lines coming together there, and the transfer sprawls across three major streets. To walk from the purple line to the dark blue would be probably 10 minutes, but underground it can be much shorter.
<br /><br /><a href="http://www.harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/20130702-120211.jpg"><img src="http://www.harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/20130702-120211.jpg" alt="20130702-120211.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a>

Seoul Metro also numbers and maps each exit for each station making it much easier to figure out where you are when you surface. In DC, perplexingly, only one exit is marked, even if another exit is a few blocks away. Farragut West, for example, has entrances at 17th and 19th streets at I street, yet Google Maps and other mapping services only show the 17th street door (which is sometimes closed). Farragut North is even more poorly mapped, with a marker on Connecticut Ave. somewhere between K and L while in fact the station has entrances at both streets and none at that marker's exact location. 

A final navigation bonus in Seoul: you can walk underground through most stations without going through a fare gate making the metro stations effective at avoiding high traffic intersections.

Navigable stations winner: Seoul Metro, hands down.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Congratulations, you found us! After far too long of freeloading server space from some old friends, we finally broke down and bought some web space. This will be our new home, and the home of any and all future projects upon which we endeavor. I've spent most of the night tinkering around with everything, changed the oil,  replaced <a title="The Office: Mafia" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/102597/the-office-mafia">a couple leaky spark tubes</a>, and now everything under the hood should be tip top, as good as new.

Have a look around and see what is new. We're looking into some fancy new gizmos to add to our site soon so be sure to check back often. Danielle should have a post coming your way soon.

Cheers]]></content:encoded>

This is a fish so disgusting "[its] other name is the slime eel because their defense mechanism is to produce a mucus that turns into unbelievable quantities of slime when mixed with water." This is the fish, you'll recall, that was impaled and skinned alive before our very eyes and then proceeded to redefine the word "writhe" for all who bore witness.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We were told this week by our Academic Coordinator that in the event we do close, all teachers are expected to come in on Saturdays and Sundays to make up for lost time. Rumors about a government edict closing all the schools abound but we have not heard anything official from the Government.

According to the Korea Times, the government raised its alert status this week, and is stepping up flu prevention strategies:
<blockquote><span>The country had maintained its "orange" alert status since July 21 but decided to raise it as an average of 8,857 people caught the new flu per day last week, up from 4,420 tallied for the week before. A total of 42 people have died in South Korea from the flu since mid-August.

Government efforts will be focused on coping with serious flu cases and vaccinating about 35 percent of the population as soon as possible to safeguard public health, the ministry said.</span></blockquote>
I'm just glad I'm part of the public option health plan.

		<title>Less Bang For North Korean Bucks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Much ado was made this week about North Korea revaluing its currency. The story first caught my eye as a headline on Twitter and, given the near lack of an economy up north I didn't think much of it, but my curiosity heightened when I saw the <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/12/116_56488.html">Korea Times</a> and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/business/global/02korea.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">New York Times</a> pick it up. Our stalinist neighbor announced this week that it would drop two zeros from its currency, issue new bills, and limit the amount of the old bills that could be exchanged.

Unsurprisingly, the change was met with harsh criticism. The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704107104574570653594393732.html">Wall Street Journal's </a>Marcus Noland called Pyongyang's bluff saying it was a decision made not out of sound economic policy, but "yet another stratagem by the central authorities to short-circuit the development of an entrepreneurial class independent of the state." Other news agencies cited a widespread, chaotic reaction from within the secretive state's borders.

The problem is not so much the revaluation itself, it is a strategy used by many stable governments to halt bad economic policies of the past and fight runaway inflation. By revaluing the currency "at approximate parity to major currencies such as the dollar or the euro," the strategy is often used as a tool for citizens to hold their government accountable for their country's economic performance. That is clearly not what is happening in North Korea. Holding the government accountable for anything is the last thing the North wants its people doing, and instead this was intended to snuff out small, underground entrepreneurs, and preventing people from holding any savings. Noland writes:
<blockquote>Unlike a Turkish or Ghanaian-style reform [two countries who recently revalued their currencies], in which all citizens are encouraged to convert all their holdings of the old currency, the North Korean regime limits the amount of currency that can be converted. This renders excess holdings worthless, and has set off the frenzy this week to get out of old won and into anything else—dollars, Chinese yuan, physical goods—that will maintain value. Any economic "reform" also creates opportunities to parcel out benefits, as with a 2002 price and wage reform that favored the military.</blockquote>
Other sources like the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/business/global/02korea.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">New York Times</a> also commented on the conversion limit as a fault of the program. The government initially only allowed 100,000 ($690, officially, $35 on the black market) to 150,000 won to be exchanged into the new bills, a rule that would "effectively decimate private stores of cash wealth in local currency." Following this decree several news outlets reported protests in the streets of Pyongyang, and chaos in the public transportation systems as people flocked home and then to their banks in attempt to redeem their new bills, and sell off the rest into something else.

In response to the protests, the North made a reluctant and disingenuous compromise. All citizens are now allowed to exchange all of their savings for the new notes, but the exchange rate will change after the first 100,000 won. According to <a href="http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&amp;num=5726">Daily NK</a>:
<blockquote>“The maximum amount per household which could be exchanged in cash was initially set at 100,000 won, but overnight it increased to 150,000 won, then subsequently a new decree was handed down.”

“According to the new decree, the exchange rate is still 100:1 for 100,000 won, but now the authorities will only permit people to exchange the rest of the money at 1,000:1.”

As a result, if you take 200,000 won in cash to a bank, you get 1,100 won in new denomination bills. This emergency formula will do nothing other than destroy the fortunes of the people. [Quotations taken from NK Daily's source.]</blockquote>
The overwhelming verdict among news agencies across the world is that the North's currency valuation scheme is targeted at two things: obliterating any kind of personal wealth, no matter how small, and shutting down any kind of entrepreneurial activity, black market or otherwise. In addition, the South Korean Unification Ministry has yet to issue an official statement on the subject because it is waiting for Pyongyang to first officially announce the unexpected economic activity.

The blog <a href="http://www.nkeconwatch.com/">North Korean Economy Watch</a> has a great collection of quotations from and links to international publications covering the revaluation scheme.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Greetings everyone, it's been a while since you last heard from us, and even longer since you heard from me. We've been pretty busy getting things in order around here, on the personal side of things, we have both been inexplicably busy lately. We're thinking about the future, and trying to get things in order to apply for our next <a href="http://cetp.info">job</a>. Those of you who follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/gboone42">twitter</a> probably know I was at home for about two weeks over the Thanksgiving holiday. My grandma was undergoing surgery for pancreatic cancer and my return home was an emergency trip to be with her and my family while she prepared for and recovered from the Whipple Procedure. Now that it's Christmas, Danielle is at home with her family, and my brother Tony arrived earlier this week to visit during my winter break.

In addition to working on some backend upgrades on this site, we've been collaborating with Anna and Andre (<a title="Seoulful Adventures" href="http://seoulfuladventures.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Seoulful Adventures</a>) on the first of a series of journalism projects. We are currently putting together a story about the large Filipino community in and around Seoul and Incheon, centered around the weekly Filipino Market in Hyewha. Last weekend the four of us went out to the market and put in about five hours of interviewing and learning about the market, and the people who work and visit it. The project is the first of many to be produced under the umbrella of a new organization called <a title="International Underground" href="http://internationalunderground.org">International Underground</a>. We hope to have the Filipino Market story up, and launch the full site soon. We'll have more details here for sure. In the mean time, you can subscribe to the email list or the site's RSS feed in the reader of your choice.

Creating International Underground does not mean that Schoolhouse: ROK will disappear. On the contrary, it means we will be able to focus on bringing you news and analysis from this site, but also do more broadly targeted, and more in-depth journalism, reporting unique stories, from among a community of journalists located in the Seoul area, and eventually around the world.

Thank you for reading, happy holidays, and stay tuned.]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://rocktigers.com/therocktigers/images/member.jpg"></a>In the 1950s a style of music emerged in the United States that combined the sonic wonders of early Rock 'n' Roll and Hillbilly Music, a particularly swingin' kind of country music. The people who pioneered and made this music famous are not unknown souls, they are people like Johnny Cash, Elvis Presly, and especially Carl Perkins. They called it Rockabilly. <!--more-->With some notable exceptions scattered sporadically throughout the last 60 years, the genre has stayed out of the limelight, relegated to an underground, niche status. In the 70s a group called Levi and Dexter did a brief stint in the national spotlight, and in the 80s the Stray Cats, with their iconic guitarist, Brian Stezer, brought some modern Rockabilly revivals, but in the last ten years, bands like the Reverend Horton Heat and other even lesser known Rockabilly groups have stayed in the clubs, and off the mainstream charts. The notable exception here is, obviously, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, which stitched the rockabilly scene together with a growing swing revival in the late 90s and early 2000s. In the UK, Canada, and Australia there are similar underground Rockabilly scenes to that of the United States, but until recently, the only scene in Asia was in Japan. That changed in 2001 when Tiger, Velvet Geena, Eddie Tarantuala, Roy, and Jack "The Knife" burst onto the Seoul club scene as the <a title="Rock Tigers: Pioneering Rockabilly in Korea" href="http://rocktigers.com/">Rock Tigers</a>.

The self-described pioneers of Korean Rockabilly call their aggressive, up-tempo music, Kimchibilly. The band throws a show each month to showcase Kimchibilly, and this month, it will bring in a Rockabilly group from Japan called "Swamp Rats" as part of the 14th Kimchibilly night at DGBD (<em>sic</em>) on March 27th.

On stage the group looks very much like a punk-influenced Rockabilly group, with black leather jackets, a flame emblazoned upright bass, and Les Paul-style hollow-body electric guitars. Leading the pack is Velvet Geena, the only woman in the group, with shockingly ultra-blond hair and a screaming, powerful voice who dances and sings, putting on a performance that goes all the way to eleven (because ten just wouldn't be loud enough). We saw the Tigers at DGBD as part of the Hands for Haiti benefit, an event that spanned across two other venues, and donated all of its proceeds to help the relief efforts following the devastating earthquake that hit the Caribbean island earlier this year.

We were impressed with the group's stage presence and creativity. Most Korean pop music, K-Pop, is boring, obnoxious, and designed to be catchy, and thrives on sex appeal, and monetization. The Rock Tigers nail the appearance, and energy that any good live show should have, and their music doesn't lie down either. Velvet Geena's powerful voice, Tiger and Roy's wailing guitars, and the pounding of Roy's bass and Jack's kick drum, nag at that voice that say "dance." The Tigers are currently on tour but will be back in Seoul with shows on March 14, 20, 26, and rounding out the month with the Rockabilly Night on the 27th.

We took some audio at our show last month, and attached a couple of the band's music videos via their <a title="Rock Tigers: Pioneering Rockabilly in Korea since 2001" href="http://rocktigers.com">website</a>. They recently released a new album called "Rock 'n' Roll License." Make sure to check them out the next time your are in Korea, or if they ever come to your hometown.

<strong>Bonus:</strong> Our friend Andre Francisco (<a href="&lt;a href=">Seoulful Adventures</a>) makes a cameo in one of these podcasts, see if you can hear him daring me to turn off the wireless mic receivers at DGBD.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Greetings Loyal Readers,

The real news with this update is an announcement related to another project both Danielle and I are working on called <a title="International Underground: Giving voice to those who often go unseen and unheard" href="http://internationalunderground.org">International Underground</a>. We blogged about International Underground once <a title="What We're up To" href="http://harmsboone.org/what-were-up-to">before</a>, alerting you of its existence, but now we are glad to announce it is up and running.<!--more-->

International Underground is a multimedia organization dedicated to telling the stories of those who often fail to make the headlines, or even page A27. Our first series, <a title="Inside Seoul's Filipino Community " href="http://www.internationalunderground.org/category/korea/filipino">Inside Seoul's Filipino Community</a>, attempts to give voice to one of the largest populations of migrant workers in Korea. Filipinos can be found all over the country working the so-called 3D jobs, those that are dirty, dangerous, and difficult. They work in the factories, lumber yards, manufacturing facilities, and farms, and often face adversity and discrimination. Our stories give life and voice to these workers through engaging and creative storytelling. You can read Danielle's piece,<a title="A Place to Call Their Own" href="http://www.internationalunderground.org/korea/filipino/place-call-their-own"> A Place to Call Their Own: Seoul's Raphael Clinic</a>, and hear my audio piece, <a title="A Culture of Support" href="http://www.internationalunderground.org/korea/filipino/culture-support">A Culture of Support</a>, on the International Underground website at <a title="International Underground" href="http://www.internationalunderground.org/">http://internationalunderground.org</a>, if you enjoy what you see, hear, and read, please subscribe to the email list, or the rss feed, and visit the <a title="International Underground on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Underground/368312381401?ref=ts">facebook</a> and <a title="International Underground on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/intl_undergrnd">twitter</a> profiles. These articles will likely be cross-posted in some form to this blog, but not for a while.

As far as Schoolhouse: ROK goes, we have some entries in progress, and we hope to get back to more regular updates for you all. Those of you who frequent the site may have noticed we have a new design layout for Schoolhouse: ROK. For those keeping score, this is the third time we changed up the layout and design for the Schoolhouse: ROK blog. Hopefully things are pretty easy to find, we're hoping they are easier to find with this layout, particularly for those of you on any version of Internet Explorer. We only recently realized how terrible the old layout looked for you folks. We're working on a new design for the whole site, rethinking it from the ground up, that should launch sometime this summer. Until then we think this <a title="WP-Theme: Notepad" href="http://www.ndesign-studio.com/wp-themes/notepad">notepad</a>-like theme is an elegant solution.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>30 Days of Biking</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently began participating in a great online group called 30 Days of Biking. The goal, to ride your bike every day during the month of April. <!--more-->So far I've only missed one day, and it was because I was at a wedding in Incheon all day and had no time to get out on the bike. Sad, I know. I've been doing well so far though, and contacted the folks running the blog to see about being a guest writer and they were thrilled. This morning, Seoul time, my piece was published. I talk about my recurring dream of showing Lance Armstrong around Ilsan, and try to give readers some idea of what it's like to be on the road out here.
<blockquote>In Korea, especially in the bigger cities, traffic can be a bit intimidating. Drivers on the mean streets of Ilsan are erratic at best and inattentive at their worst. Because biking is so popular here and traffic laws are a bit looser, drivers are used to sharing the road with smaller, slow-moving, non-motorized vehicles, which sometimes makes biking on the streets easy. The problems then, tend to be more with regard to people parking on corners, stopping in the middle of intersections, and being impatient at stoplights. It could be worse, but it’s the best option available.</blockquote>
You can read the whole thing on the <a title="30daysofbiking.com" href="http://30daysofbiking.com/bike/2010/04/living-strong-30daysofbiking-in-korea/">30 Days of Biking website</a>. The group has gotten quite a bit of media attention, and they are welcoming riders from around the world. They are tracking miles on <a title="30 Days of Biking Challenge—Daily Mile" href="http://www.dailymile.com/challenges/1017-30-day-of-biking">DailyMile</a>, and keeping up a healthy conversation on <a title="#30daysofbiking" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%2330daysofbiking">Twitter</a>. I'll be writing more about biking in Ilsan for this blog soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Globalizing Korea: A Rhetoric of Food</title>
		<link>http://www.harmsboone.org/globalizing-korea-rhetoric-of-food</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Daniel Gray, a <a href="http://seouleats.com">Seoul Eats</a> food blogger, recently published an op-ed in the <a href="http://koreaherald.com">Korea Herald</a> regarding the public and private efforts to export Korean culture to the West—particularly to the United States. With coverage from the New York Times, CNN, and other high profile news organizations in the US, the government seems to be doing a fair job of gaining the attention of Western eyes, and now is focusing on making Korean food America's Next Top Asian Cuisine.<!--more-->

Gray argues that Seoul should focus on which specific foods to export to different parts of the world, and how to market those foods abroad. He writes:
<blockquote>Take the full page "Bibimbap" advertisement that was in the New York Times on Dec. 21. First of all, I applaud the Korean show "Infinite Challenge" for the initiative. The ad had a great headline: "How about Bibimbap for lunch today?" There was a gorgeous picture and they gave the phone numbers of several Korean restaurants in New York.

The text is what I have a problem with: "It is said that this dish came from the customers of memorial service and rural villages. This dish is very convenient to provide, just mixing of cooked rice with various vegetables, namul, and red pepper paste together."

First of all, death (customers of memorial service) doesn't arouse my appetite and non-Korean speakers will not know what "namul" is. It was a great idea, just poor execution.

The way that Koreans market Korean food for Koreans will not work overseas. Korea's "four seasons," "well-being," "good-for-health," "kimchi," and the "5 colors" will not convince the average person to try Korean food.</blockquote>
Awkward language aside, this ad is problematic for more reasons that Gray's analysis reveals. Gray claims that the primary reason certain Korean foods will not catch on in the states and elsewhere is the taste and textures of the foods. It is true that some cultures are naturally more open to certain foods than others. For example, Gray writes about a series of interviews his company, O'ngo Food Communications, did with foreigners regarding their favorite Korean foods.  His research, apparently "found that many French people liked chicken and ginseng soup. They said it reminded them of a popular French dish:<em> poule au pot</em>." Gray believes that these results lead to the obvious conclusion that certain foods export across cultures better than others. While that may certainly be true, it is a myopic analysis that isolates food from the larger context of the food's cultural origin. The problem is not exclusively a taste issue, though that is certainly part, and cultural differences do determine what tastes "good" to people. So far, Korea has failed to recognize how their culture fits within another culture. That is, more than anything else, Korean companies have a rhetorical problem, not an attracting people into restaurants problem.
<h2>The Romanization Problem</h2>
One component of the debate that erupted on the food blogs in Korea is over the proper spelling of Korean foods using Roman characters. Specifically, the conversation has debated whether Makgeolli is a proper or effective transliteration of the Korean word. Makgeolli is the proper spelling according to the government's current (now standardized) romanization system, however, that does not mean it is a spelling that makes sense for westerners. <a href="http://www.zenkimchi.com/FoodJournal/">ZenKimchi</a> weighed in on the issue saying that the spelling of Makgeolli is fine for the government to use, but that "the '-kg' and the '-eo'are problematic...[for] English speakers unfamiliar with the official Korean romanization." This is likely true. "kgeo" is not a string of letters commonly found in English, which will make it hard to pronounce. ZenKimchi argues that Seoul should keep the standard romanization system they've developed, and "that interested stakeholders (e.g., producers and promoters) come up with a better romanization for the word in question, one that accurately reflects the Korean pronunciation."

In researching for <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/lifestyle/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100202000013">How Not To Globalize Korean Food</a>, Gray conducted a crude market research study to determining the best ways to Romanize the Korean word Makgeolli. The methodology was this: write down several spellings of 막걸리 with Makgeolli at the top of the list, find a bunch of foreigners, and ask them which pronunciation is best. Zen Kimchi's <a href="http://www.zenkimchi.com/FoodJournal/archives/2426">Andrew Salmon</a> illustrates some of the obvious problems with this method:
<blockquote>He [Gray] is posing the question to [those] who already understand the government’s romanization system. However, the overwhelming percentage of the world’s non-Korean population is NOT familiar with this system, which, naturally, has certain quirks.</blockquote>
The Korean language has many quirks, and its alphabet is equally idiosyncratic. In May 1972 Richard Rutt in the Korea Journal called Korean "a singularly intractable language for romanizing." Rutt attributes this mostly to the "excellence" of the Korean alphabet, Hangul. The alphabet was designed in 1440 by King Sejong as a way of allowing the people to learn how to read and write their own language. Though scholars like <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nonRl2cerIgC&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;ots=c09T_vn8FJ&amp;dq=history%20of%20korean%20writing&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20korean%20writing&amp;f=false">Ki-Moon Lee</a> in <em>The Korean Alphabet</em>, edited by Young-Ki Kim-Renaud, suggest that Sejong invented Hangul in a more Edisonian fashion—with Sejong as the mastermind and many people working around him, the official record claims he did it <a href="http://www.korean.go.kr/eng_hangeul/">entirely by himself</a>.

Prior to Hangul's invention Koreans used Chinese characters to represent their language, which meant that like Chinese, Koreans needed to memorize thousands of complicated, individual characters, their stroke order, and the words they represent. Sejong decided it was time the Koreans had a system for reading and writing that matched the nature of the unique Korean language. According to the Korean government, Sejong invented the language "to contribute to a better life for the sake of ordinary people." Since its creation, this alphabet for the people has been hailed as the world's most scientific lettering system and the first alphabet intentionally created for a specific language.

Since Sejong's time, Hangul has proliferated across the peninsula. After overcoming resistance from the nobility, who saw hangul as a threat to their power, it eventually became the prominent and only way of writing the Korean language. During their occupation, the Japanese unsuccessfully attempted to wipe out Hangul completely. Despite these uphill battles, it is hard to envision modern Korea without Hangul.

If the peculiarities of the Korean language can account for what drove the adoption of Hangul over the insufficient Chinese characters (known as Hanja), they are what historically have driven discussions over romanization. Over the years many different systems for transliterating the language to the Roman alphabet have been adopted. Rutt covered the progression of romanization standards, and suggested that the systems devised by Yale and McCune-Reischauer are the best systems, but also that there may not be a perfect way of transliterating the language. Even with a standardized system there are still  significant<a href="http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Revised:Romanization:of:Korean.htm"> problems with the 2002 revision</a>. Indeed, if one looks at other Asian languages, the romanization methods are far from perfect and more an approximation of how to speak the language than an exact guide. For example, the way most Americans pronounce Seoul is far from the proper Korean pronunciation. The best way to accurately pronounce Korean words is obviously to learn to read Hangul itself, a task far less daunting than it sounds.

This is why Salmon's argument that "if Korea needs to communicate an unfamiliar product to global audience, it needs to: (a) Make the English reflective of the Korean original" doesn't hold much weight. Though Salmon is right in that Korean words are difficult to pronounce, a more familiar spelling is not likely what will get people buying Korean food.
<h2>Think Global, Act Local</h2>
Salmon is right when he argues that the so-called "international" market research done by many food companies and the Korean government is insufficient and ignores the fact that not all foreigners are created equal. He writes,
<blockquote>"When testing perceptions of the international community, it needs to be done - as a general rule - on subjects outside Korea, rather than those who are already here, who have in-built knowledge that the wider world will not. The latter approach results in misleading findings, and sets marketing strategies off on the wrong foot from day one."</blockquote>
If the Korean government and the Korean people are serious about exporting their food, they need to remove the blinders and think beyond their own borders. Gray is likewise correct when he writes about how terrible the Bibimbap advertisement in the New York Times was, but it is not just because death does not arouse an appetite in, at least, Americans. It is because death, dying, and funerals are not thought of in the same way in American culture as they are in Korean culture.

In the US there is a funeral ritual, and the deceased are respected and honored, but Korean culture has a totally different set of cultural properties associated with death and the dead. Americans do not, for example, have a three day holiday dedicated to paying homage to ancestors as Koreans do—Chuseok. There are no rules about serving food to dead people, nor are there colors in which we may not write someone's name without casting a death wish upon them. It may be the case that bibimbap has a history of being food served to "customers of memorial services," but in the U.S. funeral food is not exactly a culinary delicacy. In addition, in modern Korea the rice and veggie "casserole" is everywhere, and there are plenty of ways to market it to Americans. It's a hearty bowl of rice, whatever vegetables are around, and a special sauce that makes it just spicy enough to give it some kick. It's a meal that's perfect for "carbing up" before a run or hike.

This is not to say that Seoul should surrender Korean values and tradition in order for its products to cross the Pacific. If Seoul is serious about selling Bibimbap—or any other Korean food—to Americans, however, it must meet Americans on their turf. Seoul needs to show Americans what they've been missing; how Korean food fits into the existing culture in the United States. This is hardly a new idea. When American companies export their products overseas, it comes with adjustments for the local culture. McDonalds for example, (it's worth noting here that a commentator on Seoul Eats made a similar argument) sells products in nearly every country in which it exists that are simply unavailable in the US—Curry Chicken McNuggets in China, bulgogi burgers in Korea, and beer in parts of Europe. It is no surprise then, that McDonalds is wildly successful in Korea and other countries around the world. If Seoul does not account for other local traditions and culture when attempting to globalize their food, it simply will not work.
<h2>A Rhetoric of Food</h2>
It is obvious to many foreigners living in Korea that Koreans have a great deal of pride in their language, culture, and country. To see a country the size of Indiana set such an ambitious goal as to export their food all over the world is truly admirable. Seoul must change its strategy to realize this goal, however. The Korean government and private companies must target specific groups of Americans and determine what will cause them to add their neighborhood Korean restaurant to the list of places they frequent. Korean food already fits into the melting pot of the United States.

While some foods are totally foreign to American tongues, a lot of Korean food is similar to other Asian cuisines. Mandoo is nearly the same as Chinese dumplings, or wontons, and the noodle soups are similar to Chinese noodle soups that are already popular. A staple of Korean dining, the banchan are essentially side dishes, something Americans already know, love, and will even pay a premium to eat. Americans love grilling, and they love drinking while doing it—give them a  restaurant in which they can do both, in a foreign and exotic environment, and you can play to American ideas of being worldly and cultured while engaging them in something familiar, something with which they can already identify. There is definitely a place for Korean barbecue in the United States, there is a place for tteokbokki, bibimbap, kalguksu, and there is a huge place for banchan and makgeolli, but Americans do not know it yet.

One of the best ways to promote Korean food in American culture might be to use the million or so foreigners in Korea to promote Korean food in their homelands. Maybe Seoul could set up a system offering grants, loans, or support to teachers who want to start up a Korean restaurant once they return home. As evidenced by the quantity and content of food blogs in Korea, there are many foreigners with strong opinions about Korean food. They are already semi-experts on Korean food—or at least more so than anyone else in the US—and they are also experts on the culture of their homeland, thus making them perfect candidates for promoting and selling Korean food and culture to the masses.

There are foreigners living in Korea who love Korean food. Some avoid it, but the majority are likely somewhere in the middle, with a few favorite dishes, and a few dishes they rarely touch. The best thing Seoul could do to promote Korean food is to get the foreigners into Korean restaurants upon repatriation, and to bring their friends and money with them. The bottom line is that food, like other parts of culture, is an idea unique to that culture. When it comes down to it, Seoul's goal is rhetorical. It is about finding a way for Americans to identify with Korean food.

In<em> A Rhetoric of Motives</em>, Kenneth Burke introduced the idea of identification as a significant part of rhetoric. He argued it is not enough to think about rhetoric as the ways someone might persuade an audience. Because we are born divided people (or cultures, for the purpose of this article), we strive to mitigate that division by joining with others that share our interests and values. Persuasion is driven by this intrinsic need to join with others, or have others join with us so that we may find some cohesion within the social order or hierarchy in which we find ourselves as individuals. In order to successfully export Korean food, Seoul needs to persuade Americans to accept Korean food into their existing social order, and it must do that by playing to the motives and ideas that Americans already share with each other, and with Koreans. As Burke might say, Seoul's rhetorical problem is persuading Americans that the two cultures are both "joined and separate."

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'll return to this post tomorrow, but at least two things make me doubt the accuracy of it..

1) "certain foods export across cultures better than others. While that may certainly be true, it is a myopic analysis that isolates food from the larger context of the food’s cultural origin." is a deal-breaker. Dan is talking about the food in a foreign culture and if you admit that his point is true and THEN try to address the food's "cultural origin" you are indulging in the error that the Korean International Food Marketers do. They think of cultural origin, not the culture to which the food  is introduced. This is marketing fail Number One. LOL... "export" works in the landing country, not the weird fantasies of the exporting one..

2) Salmon's "point" about interviewing those who "know" how hangul sounds being a bad approach? That's insane. These are people who know the pronunciation in BOTH languages.. consequently they might be able to figure out how the sounds of hangul would translate into the sounds of English.

The concluding points, which don't seem to be coated in animus, are right on.

I mean.. how could properly marketed BBQ not work? And all the theoretical palaver about the Rhetoric of Motives? Sure.. and the other great thing about BBQ is that it does cut through theoretical crap and bring us all together at a communal table. And this is particularly true of Korean BBQ.

This harmsboone post strains mightily under its own weight. 

LOL.. as I do. ^^

"]<a href="http://harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_5865-e1275485232778.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-510 " title="A fifth generation makeolli brewer.

We took our first sip of makgeolli back in late September on the first night of <a title="Wooriwa: A weekend of farming in Pyeongtaek" href="http://harmsboone.org/wooriwa">our farming adventure with Wooriwa</a>, pouring from enormous drums like the kind my Grandpa once used to fill up the pontoon with gas at the cabin. Since then, we have become enamored with the beverage, and perplexed by its composition. About a month ago we had the pleasure of learning how the beverage is brewed by the people who knew it best: fifth generation professionals.<!--more-->

Foreigners often call makgeolli a rice wine. In fact, makgeolli is not wine at all, as numerous food bloggers around Seoul have pointed out. It is not made like wine, and it does not look or taste like wine. Some may argue over what the proper genre makgeolli belongs in, but regardless of what it should be, makgeolli is delicious, and a must taste for all visitors to the Land of the Morning Calm. With its white color, don't make the mistake a friend did on his first week in Korea and douse your cerial in the opaque white substance. It may look vaguely like milk, but it tastes nothing like it. The milky-hued, slightly sweet beverage is a perfect addition to any meal of pajeon and bossam, or just to sip through an outdoor concert in Hongdae. It is traditionally sipped from bronze bowls, and served from a kettle to match. Like the drink itself, the brewing process is at once straightforward and mysterious.

[caption id="attachment_509" align="alignright" width="341" caption="Mashing up the nuruk Korean style: with our hands. "]<a href="http://harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_5858.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-509" title="Mashing up the nuruk Korean style: with our hands. " src="http://harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_5858-341x512.jpg" alt="" width="341" height="512" /></a>[/caption]

The first step is to acquire a lot of rice. The main ingredient by far, there is a special variety of rice that produces the best makgeolli, but in a pinch a long grain rice you can buy at the grocery store should get the job done. When we brewed our makgeolli the exact proportions were unclear because we were brewing a lot of makgeolli as a large group, but the quantity was more than you could make in a rice cooker at home. The <a title="UN Food and Agriculture Organization: Fermented Cereals a global perspective " href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/x2184e/x2184e09.htm">UN's Food and Agriculture Organization</a> says 4 parts. Before you start the cooker, soak the rice in water (10 parts) for about an hour, then stop the cooking process before it's cooked all the way. Let the rice cool down and then taste it. After your taste test is over, spread the rice out on your counter top. You may want to put down a sushi mat, or something else that will keep the rice from sticking to the counter.

After rice the second most important ingredient in this process is called <em>nuruk</em>. It was described to us as whole wheat yeast cake but that's not particularly helpful, and we suspected there was more to it than that. According to The <a title="FAO: Fermented cereals a global perspective" href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/x2184e/x2184e09.htm">FAO</a>, <em>Nuruk</em> is "wheat, rice, barley (whole grain, grits or flour)" with the fermenting microorganisms "Aspergillus, Rhizopus, [and] yeasts" packed together into a large cake, and then incubated for about three weeks, dried for two, and aged for about two months. We had seen these <em>nuruk</em> cakes around grocery stores and markets in town, but never really knew what they were. To the untrained eye, they look almost like a strangely shaped bird's nest. To make makgeolli, the <em>nuruk </em>(one part) is added to mineral water and broken into tiny pieces with the hands until it is a muddy color and consistency. Once the mixture is at a proper consistence, add in the rice, and mix it in thoroughly.

Korean cooking values working with your hands, and a lot of things that people elsewhere would use tools for, Koreans do with their hands. When making makgeolli, even though it would probably be easier to do this mixing with a large spoon, or a pair of cooking chopsticks, or even maybe a blender to break up those giant chunks of <em>nuruk</em>, you should use your hands. When all the mixing is done, jar it. We suspect traditional Koreans did not use plastic jars, but if you don't have a kimchi pot laying around, it'll do in a pinch. Like beer, the longer it sits, the more alcoholic it gets; though, the FAO shows the alcohol content plateaus around 16% after 4 days. We were told to first cover it with a paper towel so that the drink could breathe—the more air those yeasts get the harder they work—and then after two days cover it and let it ferment covered for two more days. Stir the whole mixture twice per day, again to keep the yeast working hard. After four days your makgeolli is ready to drink.

[caption id="attachment_512" align="alignright" width="341" caption="The magkeolli stays busy while it ferments in its shady lair (the closet for the air conditioner). The yeast keeps it bubbling for days, eating up sugars and giving us alcohol.

After we uncovered it and took our first sips, we were a bit shocked at the sourness of the makgeolli, as were many of the people with whom we brewed. Our friends who brew beer here, and a <a title="Kyong Yun: Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/kyongyun">Twitter follower</a> of mine suggested we add sugar to the mix to both cut the edge out of the drink, up the alcohol content, and add a little more carbonation, and this seemed to do the trick. The drink was a bit strong as alcohol goes, but it can easily be watered down to taste. Friends who tried it said it tasted like makgeolli. Mission accomplished.

<h3>Update:</h3>
Thanks to some commenters below (Steve Schultz and <a href="http://flyingwood.com">Glenn Thomas</a>) I recently learned that Nuruk is available for purchase at Korean Grocery stores here in the states. It goes by the name <a href="http://www.hmart.com/shopnow/shopnow_newsub.asp?p=846034006119">Powdered Enzyme Amalase</a> and can be purchased at H-Mart.

To brew your own:

Ingredients:
<ul>
	<li>1 nuruk cake, powdered (<a title="Instructions for making nuruk" href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/x2184e/x2184e09.htm">see here for how to make a nuruk cake</a>)</li>
	<li>10 parts water</li>
	<li>4 parts rice</li>
</ul>
Directions:
<ol>
	<li>Soak rice in tepid water for 1 hour</li>
	<li>Cook the rice until it is about 80% cooked.</li>
	<li>Allow the rice to cool</li>
	<li>While rice is cooling break nuruk cake until small pieces and mix into water until it turns a mud-like color.</li>
	<li>mix in rice</li>
	<li>transfer mixture to an earthen jar (if unavailable a plastic jar will do just as well)</li>
	<li>cover jar with a paper towel, or light cloth and allow it to ferment for two days</li>
	<li>cover jar with lid and allow to ferment another two days</li>
	<li>stir the makgeolli twice per day throughout the whole fermentation process.</li>
</ol>
Bottling:
<ul>
	<li>Add one tablespoon of sugar per liter of makgeolli to each bottle</li>
	<li>Filter makgeolli mixture through a cheesecloth and pour through a funnel into each bottle</li>
	<li>seal bottles if possible, and refrigerate until ready to drink</li>
</ul>
Serving:
<ul>
	<li>To be traditional, transfer your makgeolli into a kettle, and pour into a small, bronze bowl</li>
	<li>Add water to taste</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You can buy Nukuk in Korean food markets anywhere in the US.  It is usually sold in the form of the ground up cake mentioned in this article.  One package is good for one batch (about 3 or 4 gallons).  I've made it about 20 times and it's pretty easy and always comes out great.  I take more precautions though,  I am a fanatic about keeping everything clean and sanitary and make Makolli the same way I make beer, in a fermentor with a vapor lock.  It tends to last longer because less opportunities are given for airborne molds and bacterias to enter the process.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm a little confused about the nuruk cake.  How much nuruk do you use?  If I use 10 cups water and 4 cups rice, would I use 1 cup of the liquified nuruk cake?  Does it matter how diluted it is?  And what do you mean by mineral water?  Any kind you would buy, such as Perrier?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>This was originally posted as part of <a title="30 Days of Biking" href="http://30daysofbiking.org">30 Days of Biking</a>, a group dedicated to riding their bikes "every, friggin', day."<!--more--> Since it was a few months ago now, and I promised to cross post it here, I decided it was time for this post to be cemented in the memory of Schoolhouse ROK readers everywhere. It's worth noting that about a month following this post, the air pollution and heavy traffic got to be a little exhausting and I stuck to riding to school and back only. With that caveat, I stand by my words that Korea is a great place to explore by bike.</blockquote>

<p>I had that dream again, the one where Lance Armstrong visits my little city in the Seoul suburbs as part of a new tour for LIVESTRONG, and for some reason, the powers that be put me in charge of giving him the bike tour of the city. It’s a strange dream for a few reasons, chiefly among them being that I’m not Korean but in fact a temporary resident of this town, here to teach English for the year and then be on my way. It starts at my tiny office-tel apartment wheeling my Surly out of the oversized walk-in closet of a living space I call home.</p>

<p>“We’ll go out on the main road right in front of the apartment here, take a left and head toward Lake Park, then loop around Daehwa-dong, and follow the Gyeonggui railroad line around the north end of town,” I tell Lance on the elevator ride down, “it’s one of my favorite rides.” Lance, of course, does not need to cram his bike into the elevator because his bike is waiting with some team hands from his crew. We strap on the helmets, and then head out.</p>

<p>Someone who has won the Tour de France as many times as Lance might not find this route incredibly thrilling, but the options are limited in this city, and this really is one of my favorite rides around the Ilsan district of Goyang, and it probably is the one I would take Lance on if I were so fortunate. The trickiest part of the whole loop is fending off the traffic.</p>

<p>In Korea, especially in the bigger cities, traffic can be a bit intimidating. Drivers on the mean streets of Ilsan are erratic at best and inattentive at their worst. Because biking is so popular here and traffic laws are a bit looser, drivers are used to sharing the road with smaller, slow-moving, non-motorized vehicles, which sometimes makes biking on the streets easy. The problems then, tend to be more with regard to people parking on corners, stopping in the middle of intersections, and being impatient at stoplights. It could be worse, but it’s the best option available.</p>

<p>Goyang prides itself on being a city of fitness. The tagline “Let’s Goyang” is plastered all over the city, and there are wide sidewalks and bike lanes along most major roads. A network of parks, parkways, and pedestrian zones make this town surprisingly easy to navigate on foot or by bike, despite its lack of street names or real addresses—as long as you have a good mental map. Most of the parkways stem from one central point, Lake Park. Here, a 5km bike/jogging loop winds its way around the largest artificial body of water in the peninsula. It’s a fine ride around the lake, and generally the earlier you can get out the better, particularly on the weekends. Since it is the only real place for sustained, outdoor recreation in Ilsan, it gets a bit crowded.</p>

<p>The off-street bike lanes in Korea suffer from the same problems that off-street lanes elsewhere face. They are rarely separate from the walker-only sidewalks, and if they are, it is even less likely to see a physical barrier between the two or see those barriers respected by cars, busses, and delivery scooters. Usually a white stripe painted down the center of the sidewalk, or a strip of the same stone the curbs are made from, marks the lanes. If the sidewalk narrows, the bike lane is the first to go, and regardless of how clearly marked the bike lane is, pedestrians will meander on over to the smoother, less crowded pavement on your side. The other problem with riding on the sidewalk is that sidewalks have curbs, and curbs hurt when you take them at 30kph (18mph) (if you can ever get going that fast on the sidewalk). These are curbs are not your run-of-the-mill, rounded-concrete corners, these are a little under a foot tall, mini-walls of granite meant to deter cars; just imagine what it would do to a road bike tire.</p>

<p>Riding on the streets may be dangerous, but it is definitely my preferred method. The ride I dream of taking Lance on is one of the longer rides I’ve managed to map out around Ilsan, and it was supposed to be longer, but to my surprise, half of the road on the far end of the trip was under construction. The only thing harder than biking around cars is biking around construction sites. This may be a universal truth, but in Korea, where as little of the road is closed as possible, it’s particularly prudent to wear a helmet, ride defensively, and react quickly to the unexpected.</p>

<p>My ultimate goal is to figure out how to get to Seoul from Goyang on my bike, but for the month of April, I’m determined to map a new route each day. Who knows, maybe Lance will show up some day.</p>

<p>LIVESTRONG!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently on <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/midmorning/">Minnesota Public Radio’s Midmorning program</a>, host Kerri Miller put the question to the guests and listeners of what influence bloggers, social media, and other online information organizations have on traditional press. The two stories that drove the conversation were the WikiLeaks story and the ado stirred up by Andrew Breitbart and his BigGovernment.org online news site, regarding remarks made by former USDA employee Shirley Sherrod. Each story, in its own way, challenged the public’s information literacy level. With regard to WikiLeaks, some organizations showed an exemplary level of information literacy, while many of the rest drowned in apathy toward the whole story. In the Shirley Sherrod story, however, we saw a profound display of illiteracy coupled with a troubling demonstration of how bloggers, commentators, and social media can not just control, but hijack a news cycle.<!--more-->

With the Afghanistan conflict recently surpassing all others as the longest, sustained military conflict in US history, and a public increasingly skeptical of the merits of the war and the strategies being used to bring it to a close, the WikiLeaks documents were powerful in shaping many people's views on the conflict. For some, they showed the conflict in raw form, and offered a granular, often colorful proof of what is wrong with the conflict. Others, including the White House, were dismissive, saying that while the leak of these documents harms national security, there was really nothing new, nothing to be concerned about, but that the documents should nonetheless, never have been released—a strange double standard to have for anything let alone national security.

Julian Assange, founder and editor of WikiLeaks released the database of 92,000 documents to the New York Times, Guardian UK, and Der Spiegel and gave them a month to review and digest the documents before making a story. He did this intentionally because he knew there was a story there, but also knew that he was not in a position to tell it. His organization has learned a lot, says Midmorning guest Brent Anderson of the Columbia Journalism Review, reflecting on the past history of WikiLeaks in breaking stories or artifacts that are shocking or come to dominate the news cycle. His decision to give the documents to a third party to vet them before making them public shows a maturation in his role as a source for the media, and the public. It also shows an increased sophistication as an activist.

Here is an organization with information it knows is valuable, with the means of publishing it and disrupting whatever strategy was behind keeping it closed, but instead gives it over to three of the largest media organizations in the world to let them figure out what if any perspective there is to glean from them. He admits, by not simply releasing this information, that leaking for the sake of leaking is not enough. There needs to be some context to help the public, who have neither the time nor resources to devour and digest 92,000 documents but deserve to understand what significance a leak of this magnitude has with regard to the broader issue. It is an incredible show of information literacy, and responsibility toward holding the government accountable to the people under its electorate.Indeed Assange has likely come a long way since his days as a hacker, but the mission that drives him is likely the same as it was in his youth. The hacking movement is characterized by allowing the flexibility and versatility of computers to be as unrestrained as possible. Among the virtues espoused by many hackers is the commitment to open and free information. Notable hackers include Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web (to which we owe much of what we know as the Internet), who is on record recently calling for “greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them.” This is certainly the sentiment under which WikiLeaks operates: that the Internet and modern technology can and should be used to proliferate public information.

With all the raw data being disseminated through services like Wolfram Alpha, Google, and others that are part of what Berners-Lee calls the “Open Data Movement,” it is more important than ever to have an increasingly sophisticated level of information literacy in our modern society. Indeed Julian Assange showed off his information aptitude through the manner in which he leaked the Afghanistan Diaries, but one need look no further than the other media outlets who gave the story short shrift to see that there remain parts of our society where information illiteracy runs rampant.Miller's guests talked about the way other media outlets handled the story, they said that many organizations that were not given the priviliged access to the leak dismissed it, assuming there was no scoop, and thus nothing more to report. Other outlets towed the Obama administration's line that there was no scoop at all, that these documents were nothing that was not already part of the debate. Both of these attitudes show a major failure to evaluate and digest information on the part of our news media, but in the same week the WikiLeaks documents broke came another story that illustrates a much clearer picture of the state of information literacy in our 21st century society.

Shirley Sherrod was let go from her job in the US Department of Agriculture this week on the grounds that she had not done her job fairly; she was in fact a racist. Where did this notion come from? A doctored video prepared by Andrew Breitbart at BigGovernment.org, an overtly conservative "news" organization. Breitbart used the video, which was a short, and blatantly incomplete excerpt from a speech Sherrod gave to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), in an attempt to expose racism in the ranks of President Obama's administration. The video, following the zeitgeist, went viral. Fox News commentator Bill O'Riley picked it up and called for Sherrod's resignation on his show that night, Sean Hannity discussed the video, towing Breitbart's argument that it showed unacceptable levels of racism in the Obama Administration, and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack had already asked for her resignation before O'Riley's show aired that evening, and the NAACP denounced her "remarks" nearly immediately. Miller's guests noted that none of the broadcast television networks touched it, and the ever inflammatory Glenn Beck even ignored it, showing some restraint toward what was clearly not the whole story.

Why did all these powerful and influential people react this way? For Hanity and O'Riley it makes sense, they wanted to advance the agenda, but what of their foes in the White House and the NAACP? They were frightened of what might happen if they did not get ahead of the story. Instead of acting responsibly and either ignoring it as a nattering inaccuracy, or better yet offering some counter-message strategy to combat the story, the Administration and the NAACP crumbled.

If any of these people had watched the video in its entirety they would have noticed that Shrrod was not simply telling about how she didn't help a white farmer because there were black farmers to help, she was sharing her personal struggle with the concept of race. Since when does our society have a problem with people who struggled and overcame racism? All the Administration would have had to do, if they were truly worried about potential political fallout from the benign video, is put someone on one of those news programs that did pick it up with a counter message: The Obama Administration values employees who show integrity when facing difficult choices. If anyone were to watch the rest of Sherrod's speech, they would see her dedication to serving the United States of America with a fair mind toward all Americans regardless of race, or any other personal quality. (That one's free, feel free to hire me to fight future fires.) Instead they treated Sherrod as if she were a leper, cast her from their ranks and left her alone and abandoned.

As it happened, Sherrod eventually did go herself to show the world the full video and explained for anyone who wasn't listening what it meant. Her appearance on a cable news show cleared up the situation, refuted Breitbart, and had the Obama Administration kissing her feet in apology. The whole situation shows a disturbing picture for American politics and the news media. We rapidly have a population willing to believe anything they read in a blog, and apparently a White House that does the same. The basic principle of information literacy is that any "fact" or datum collected should be evaluated against its accuracy and validity. This means, in this case, watching the whole video. It means when some hack with a blog posts a story claiming something as outlandish as racism in the White House, that claim should not be taken at face value. Information literacy is not just for students writing papers in high school and college, we as a public need to critically evaluate everything we are given. No person in the 21st century should get all of their information from just one source—be it a blog, a cable television program, or a radio program.

During an interview at Harvard's Kennedy Institute, comedian Stephen Colbert was asked what he thought of people who used his program and the Daily Show as a news program. He answered that it scares him. It scares him because his program is not news, it is comedy. As it scares Colbert that people rely on his program for news, so too should it scare us all that so many in our society, especially those with the most power and influence, rely and take for granted any information posted to blogs like BigGovernment.org, and videos published on YouTube.]]></content:encoded>

Prior to my arrival in Hungary about a month ago the only Trabant I had seen was on display at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin amidst the plethora of East German communism memorabilia. The Trabant, or Trabbi as they were affectionately known, was the only and official automobile of East Germany. The fabled vehicle survives, for most, only through the myths and legends that precede the brand that fell with the Berlin Wall.<!--more-->

"Wasn't it made of cardboard or something flimsy like that?" I asked Harald, the mid-fourties German I had the pleasure of WWOOFing with this August.

[caption id="attachment_854" align="alignleft" width="512" caption="The fabled East German automobile was manufactured in Zwickau, came in limited models, and being made from Duroplast, was the first automobile made entirely from recycled material."]<a href="http://harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2251595912_8f8c39c06f_z.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-854" title="The (in)famous Trabant" src="http://harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2251595912_8f8c39c06f_z-512x384.jpg" alt="The fabled East German automobile was manufactured in Zwickau, came in limited models, and being made from Duroplast, was the first automobile made entirely from recycled material." width="512" height="384" /></a>[/caption]

“No,” he replied, searching for the proper translation, "they were made from duroplast," he explained, "which means they never rust." One of the Trabbi's few attractive features, then, is that you can drive them through twenty or more brutal winters in North East Germany and never see a bit of material decay, but "as soon as you crash it, it's completely irreparable." They were also incredibly uncomfortable. As Harald explained, the steering wheel was only slightly left of center, and bucket seats up front, coupled with wheel wells that crowd the floorspace, made riding shotgun a little awkward.

"And they were dirty right?"

"Oh absolutely,” Harald confirmed, “because they burn a mixture of gasoline and oil, similar to a boat."

So why were Harald and I were discussing the notorious machine while working on an organic farm in rural Hungary? We saw one in the flesh and still moving, or in the duroplast, while driving from to nearby Kistelek on our Saturday break. Harald seemed at least as shocked as I was, as the last Trabbis rolled off the line in 1989, making that particular car at least 21 years old. They were so unpopular that the factories essentially went down with the Wall, possibly even faster. According to Harald, they were so detested by their owners behind the Iron Curtain that they were literally ditched at the borders for some unfortunate soul without the means of purchasing a western car.

"So, if you wanted a car in 1989, all you had to do was go across the border and have a car."
At Checkpoint Charlie—or somewhere near it—you can pile five people into a Trabbi and take one for a spin—a premium tourist novelty spin, that is. Since arriving here I have seen dozens of them, adding to the silliness of the tourist trap in Berlin. In Budapest and here in Kaposvár they were but one reminder of Hungary's not-so-distant Soviet history. The capital city today stands as a living history book, showcasing nearly every epoch of the Nation's rough and tumble timeline. From the Citadel and Castle atop the Buda hills, to the Trabbis and EU projects in Pest that make up Budapest's workaday landscape, it is all present and accounted for.

It seems like around every corner a new construction site waits, and it isn't just in Budapest. Evidence of what Rick Steeves terms Europe's "internal Marshall Plan" can be seen all over Hungary.<!--more-->

Ask a Hungarian about all of it and two main viewpoints emerge: a cautious optimism about the new government's alleged ability to fix all the problems created by the old government (comprised of many former communist leaders who were recently outsed by two-thirds of the Hungarians in favor of a more conservative government), and a cynical distrust for all politicians’ ability to do anything but serve selfish interests.

"They are all the same," said one of my colleagues matter-of-factly, "some people think things will change, but they won't. They are all the same, and only concerned with themselves." It's easy to understand this mentality. For many the last 20 years post-communisim has been a mixed bag. On the one hand they have new-found liberty, but that liberty comes with a price.

"It pains me to see beggars on the streets of Budapest," said one Hungarian, lamenting the social ills of her present-day homeland that were unheard of most of her life. Yet despite the problems, most seem to agree that the republic will survive, and through the support of the rest of Europe, regain its status as a prominent player. Indeed to an outsider, it is hard to see the fruits of European Union membership and not think Hungary is moving forward.

"This whole area," one resident of Kaposvár said with a gesture to include the whole of our town square, "was empty, always empty. Nothing ever happened here." There was a festival going on to mark the completion of a newly restored and beautified Kossuth Square while we spoke. She told us, not only was this festival new, but so were most of the cafes and restaurants around where we sat. The theater across the street was some kind of run down cinema pub until that Saturday when the city was invited to wander through and witness the EU funded restoration effort and learn when to come back for the next show.

Mark Twain once said that there are three kinds of lies: "Lies, damn lies, and statistics." By the numbers it is easy to compare—as many in the media have recently—Hungary with Greece. With high unemployment, high inflation, high interest rates, and a bankrupt public transit system, it is no lie, nor a secret, that Hungary's economic picture is not so rosy. But numbers can only tell so much. Perhaps this new government really is a silver bullet, or perhaps it's the sheer mentality of perseverance that this culture seems to exude, but regardless of what it ends up being, this nation is moving somewhere positive, and while it's moving, the Trabbis will help serve a benchmark for how far they have come.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>

<a title="Author and social commentator Malcolm Gladwell" href="http://gladwell.com">Malcolm Gladwell's</a> most recent article for the <em><a title="The New Yorker" href="http://newyorker.com">New Yorker</a></em>, <a title="Small Change: Gladwell's take on Twitter, Facebook, and Digital Media. The revolution, he says, will not be tweeted." href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell">"Small Change,"</a> immediately triggered backlash from critics disagreeing to varying degrees with his case against social media. Gladwell is many things: a best-selling author, one of my favorite contributors to the <em>New Yorker</em>, and a big thinker uniquely capable of getting to the point quickly and concisely. Like all good writers and commentators, however, he cannot be right about everything. Small Change is one example.

The crux of his argument was that all of the hype about social media—though he seemed particularly vexed about <a title="What's happening?" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a title="A place to connect" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>—and their contributions to social movements, is for naught. He used the civil rights movement of the 1960s as a standard against which more recent social movements that were supposedly aided or organized through Twitter could be judged. Gladwell said these media are useless for meaningful activism because they are "built around weak ties,” and that this is the key point "evangelists of social media" miss. Social media campaigns, he wrote, work because they do not ask too much of people, they increase participation "by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires... in other words, Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice, but by motivating them to do the things people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice." To write them off as useless is akin to saying the telephone is useless because the American Revolution successfully launched and liberated the United States from England without it. Perhaps he was right that people so far have not been critical enough of these new media, and have taken every phenomenon tweeted as a sign of the amazing power they wield in creating social change, but his conclusion is myopic to a fault.

In "Small Change," Gladwell asked his readers to believe that participants in social movements are either willing to make a huge sacrifice, or are just useless spectators, but social movements need spectators to become motivated into active participation. In other words, social movements, including the civil rights movement, do not just appear and instantly have millions of participants, movements need to recruit the spectators to join the activists. Surely Gladwell realized that.

Writing for the <em><a title="All the news that's fit to print." href="http://nytimes.com">New York Times</a></em>, <a title="William Powers responds to Malcolm Gladwell" href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/09/29/can-twitter-lead-people-to-the-streets/digital-and-traditional-tools-arent-mutually-exclusive">William Powers, author of "Hamlet's Blackberry"</a>, asked whether the question is as "binary" as Gladwell made it. "Twitter and Facebook aren't going to change the world," he wrote, "but when used alongside other tools of human connectedness... the new technologies can be extremely useful." When organizing a social movement, it is important to identify exactly how to deploy these technologies to maximize their utility. In rhetoric one of the classical ways of analyzing an artifact is to examine how the rhetor, or author, utilized all the available means of persuasion. As technologies change, and media evolve, so to do the means of persuasion. The great social movements of the future will be those that leverage all media—traditional and digital—and all means of persuasion effectively. Similarly, the social movements of yesterday should be examined through the lens of how all means of persuasion were utilized. The civil rights movement was successful, precisely due to the sum of its many coordinated parts.

Gladwell asked rhetorically, "Of what use would a digital communication tool be in a town where ninety-eight per cent of the black community could be reached every Sunday morning at church?" Since he put forth the question, it is worth imagining how the movement might have used them to turn spectators into activists. Had those churches blogged or podcasted their sermons, and the students who courageously sat down at that lunch counter used social media tools to communicate with a network, the movement may have grown more rapidly. Perhaps the sit-ins would have spread further, faster as the movement was able to communicate with more people, in more disparate locations, more quickly. People could have used Facebook to invite friends to join them at church, or read the newspaper, or turn on the radio or TV, just to get information and participate in a low-risk, weak tie way; the leaders of the movement could have easily used these networks to build their base of participants and then encourage further activism. But it is an impossible situation to imagine. If for example, Jim Crow laws had prohibited Blacks from accessing the Internet, it wouldn't have mattered what existed since the tools were simply unavailable.

Gladwell unfairly compared the massively successful American civil rights movement, where new media were not even part of the equation, to isolated protests in places where (as Gladwell admits) "very few Twitter accounts exist," and weak cases of minor social activism where social and new media were part of the equation. The reality Gladwell conveniently ignores is that a social movement in the US on the scale of civil rights has not really happened since these new media have existed. There is however, a growing social movement for civil rights happening, with the help of the Internet, in China.

<a title="Michael Anti responds to Gladwell" href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/09/29/can-twitter-lead-people-to-the-streets/in-china-weak-ties-are-better-than-nothing-6">Michael Anti</a>, also for the <em>Times</em>, wrote that while social media will not organize a revolution, "faster access to information can be the crack in the system," in a country like China where the state controls as much of the available means of persuasion as possible. "Through the Internet," he argued, "we are starting to have a chance at getting the truth." Chinese social media use was just one artifact of Gladwell's unfortunate oversight of how people are using social media in creative ways to bring about social change.

For many years professional writers, hobbyists, and angst-filled teens alike have all had a platform to publish their thoughts, stories, and (bad) poetry to the world; it is called blogging. Since the late 1990s individuals could post to a growing number of blogging platforms like <a title="Code is poetry" href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>; they could join discussions with people all across the globe through forums powered by <a title="The no. 1 open source bulletin board software." href="http://www.phpbb.com">phpBB</a> and collaborate on projects like <a title="Quickly becoming the standard repository for all knowledge and wisdom." href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>. These platforms are still being developed, and are freely available on the Internet because they are "open source." These projects are all basically defined by a legal license that liberates software from the constraints of a copyright, but also the community of programmers, computer scientists, and users who create and use the software. Any individual with a computer may contribute to the development and user experience of an open source project. The communities that maintain and curate open source projects are a special kind of social movement and a concrete example of one is the story of WordPress.

WordPress emerged from the remains of an abandoned blogging project called "<a title="Don't panic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2/cafelog">b2/cafelog</a>". A blogger with almost no experience programming named <a title="Just this guy, you know? The lead developer of WordPress" href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> contributed a plugin and that was so useful it was eventually committed to the next version. A few years later, b2's lead developer disappeared.

Several things could have happened at this point. If b2 were a copyright protected, proprietary project, it would have stagnated, bugs and all, until the copyright expired. The bloggers likely would have lost whatever work was trapped on their obsolete sites. But b2 was not proprietary, it was open source. When the time came to decide whether to keep it or kill it, Mullenweg picked it up and maintained the abandoned software. With the help of just one other developer, Mullenweg turned the artists, developers, and web enthusiasts on b2 into the earliest adopters of WordPress. Mullenweg's code has since grown into one of the most popular content management systems on the market. It is used by behemoth organizations like the New York Times, and small time sites like this one.

WordPress has only <a title="About WordPress, a little history and biography" href="http://wordpress.org/about/">a few lead developers</a>, but beneath the surface lies an expansive network of millions of programmers, designers, and ordinary individuals participating, at varying levels, in the social movement centered around the platform.

That's all fine and well, Gladwell might argue, but where is the systemic change, the sacrifice? These projects present real challenges to institutions like <a title="Really?" href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, a company who's market-share is being eroded on four fronts by open source projects. The dominant Internet browser in the early days of the World Wide Web was Microsoft's Internet Explorer, in the early mobile market Windows Mobile and CE were powerful players, Windows still has a stronghold on the operating system market, and for years Microsoft has also led the desktop publishing field with Office. For a long time, Microsoft had little real threats in these areas. Today each has serious competition with a distinct price advantage: free. In browsers, <a title="It's fast, it's pretty, it's open source. Firefox 3.6" href="http://getfirefox.com">Mozilla Firefox</a> and <a title="Browse the web, Chrome Fast" href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> are rising to the occasion; in mobile, it's <a title="See also: your smartphone" href="http://www.android.com/">Google's Android</a> platform; <a title="Ubuntu is created by open-source developers because we believe that everybody should have access to the best possible technologies." href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> makes a fine alternative to Windows; and the <a title="The free and open productivity suite" href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice Suite</a> gives free access to the same services Microsoft Office offers for hundreds of dollars. They all come with free support, and upgrades for life. If Microsoft's mid-bogglingly large software empire being dismantled by a social movement is not enough of an institutional takedown for Gladwell, it is not clear what is.

All of these projects are held together by weak ties, but are not organized around them. Each project has a team of developers who maintain and distribute the complete project. They make decisions about which features to include for the next version, what features to deprecate, and manage the release schedule. Some, especially those organized by Google, are more structured than others, but despite the centralized organization, each open source project is only as strong as the unique contributions made by individuals who participate, however passively, throughout the development process. This network of developers is held together by individuals experimenting with the software, writing plugins, designing user interfaces, contributing to support wikis, answering questions on Twitter and email lists, and yes, even through old-fashioned face-to-face interaction.

The WordPress team tours the world each year hosting a series of workshops called <a title="essions on how to use WordPress more effectively, beginning plugin and theme development, advanced techniques, security, etc." href="http://central.wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a> for casual bloggers and advanced power-users alike. WordCamps strengthen the weak ties that hold the community together and encourage people to become more involved, active, and dedicated to the WordPress movement. The sacrifice for getting involved is that anything contributed to WordPress is—<a title="WordPress developer Justin Tadlock on Premium Themes" href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/05/29/screw-the-premium-theme-market">or should be</a>—free. If someone is a new programmer, that person is giving up hours of their lives to learn new programming languages, test code, and make whatever contribution they can, all to give it away for free. Maybe this isn't enough of a sacrifice for Gladwell. Perhaps for him, a social movement isn't real unless it is dangerous to participate in; unless you risk death or imprisonment, but contributing to an open source project is a sacrifice nonetheless.

Gladwell ends Small Change by pretentiously dismissing NYU Professor Clay Shirky's book "Here Comes Everybody" by retelling one of its stories about a Wall Streeter losing his cell phone, and recovering it using an amalgam of online resources. "A networked weak-tie world," Gladwell concludes," is good at things like helping Wall Streeters get phones back from teen-age girls," and nothing else. This is clearly not the case, and a surprisingly narrow conclusion to draw about new communication tools that help give the Chinese freedom of speech, chip away at multibillion dollar companies, and give ordinary citizens access to ideas and voices from across the globe.

		<title>Perspectives on the News: Juan Williams</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this week <em>NPR</em> fired news analyst Juan Williams in part for comments he made on <em>Fox News'</em> O'Rilley Factor. The comment was not well worded, but on a 24-hour, ratings-driven, news network, and especially on The O'Rilley Factor, it's almost impossible to choose your words carefully. O'Rilley has a way of goading his guests and full-on ignoring them when they say things with which he disagrees. He is notorious for this, and Williams and <em>NPR</em> surely knew that before he went on the program. After the firing, the public, politicians, and media communities erupted in criticism against <em>NPR</em>. Republican leaders including <a title="Jim DeMint vows to cut funds for NPR and PBS." href="http://www.thestate.com/2010/10/22/1525738/demint-vows-to-strip-federal-funding.html">South Carolina Representative Jim DeMint</a> called for <em>NPR's</em> federal funding to be revoked, long-time <em>NPR</em> listeners threatened to stop donating forever, and affiliate stations also <a title="WBUR distances itself from the Juan Williams controversy" href="http://www.wbur.org/2010/10/22/wbur-statement-juan-williams">distanced themselves from the network</a> while demanding an answer from it.

Some have called <em>NPR's</em> action censorship, and to be sure it is not; at least not the kind that violates the US Constitution. <em>NPR</em> is a private, non-profit organization that receives a <em>portion </em>of it's funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a government-run corporation. To call <em>NPR</em> a state agency that must protect and observe the Constitution is laughable. With that said, there is something to the notion that American organizations should honor the freedom of speech guaranteed by the constitution regardless of whether they are part of the government. They may not be constitutionally obligated to, but they merely should out of respect for American liberty. That reasoning, however, ultimately suggests that any individual has the liberty to slander their employer and have ultimate job security. Surely Rep. DeMint wouldn't want a senior campaign staffer going on <em>Meet the Press</em> and opining to the nation that the Representative is a bigoted numb-skull with no grasp on reality; he certainly has a right to say it, but not while working for Representative DeMint's campaign. Similarly, <em>NPR</em> does not want its employees going on national television and behaving in a manner that violates their code of ethics which expressly states that "<em>NPR</em> journalists should not express views they would not air in their role as an <em>NPR</em> journalist. They should not participate in shows . . . that encourage punditry and speculation rather than fact-based analysis." Williams' comments were what <em>MPR's</em> Bob Collins called "a run-in with reality."

Juan Williams had absolutely every right to say what he said on The Factor. He had every right to appear on Bill O'Rilley's show, every right to express his anxieties, and had that right every time he appeared on the show. He still has that right, and has actively demonstrated it by accepting a new $2 million contract with <em>Fox News</em>. What is important for Williams, <em>Fox News</em>, and <em>NPR</em> listeners to understand is that a liberty as great as those protected by the First Amendment comes with responsibilities, and that while you have a right to say something, that does not mean there are not consequences for your speech. For Williams, that consequence was losing his job at <em>NPR</em>.

As Vivian Schiller and the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2010/10/21/130713285/npr-terminates-contract-with-juan-williams#more">Alicia Shepard, NPR Ombudsman</a>, said in separate remarks, this was not the first time Williams' Fox News commentaries went against the grain. "Williams’ appearances on Fox News, especially O’Reilly’s show, have caused heartburn repeatedly for <em>NPR</em> over the last few years." Shepard continued to detail the Stokely Carmichael-in-a-designer-dress incident from 2009, and the 2008 change of his role as "correspondent (a reporting job) to news analyst." While Shepard admits that NPR handled the incident poorly, "this latest incident with Williams centers around a collision of values: NPR's values emphasizing fact-based, objective journalism versus the tendency in some parts of the news media, notably <em>Fox News</em>, to promote only one side of the ideological spectrum."

Juan Williams on <em>Fox News</em> was an entirely different voice than the one we heard on <em>NPR</em>. On NPR he fit the model for reasoned discourse on issues of public importance, on <em>Fox News</em>, he fit their model. On <a title="PBS Newshour discusses the Juan Williams controversy" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/newshour_index.html"><em>PBS's </em><em>Newshour</em></a> this week Callie Crossley, host of the<em> Callie </em><em>Crossley</em><em> Show</em>, noted, that there are two different cultures between <em>NPR</em> and <em>Fox News</em>, and it becomes impossible to reconcile Williams the <em>Fox News</em> pundit and Williams the <em>NPR</em> analyst when those two roles appear radically different. "There is one person, Mara Liasson, who is operating in both the cultures," said Crossley, "the difference there is that she is consistent in her tone, temperament and opinion wherever she is."

In the end <em>NPR</em> did what it had to do. Some have gotten hung up on what constitutes fact-based analysis, and <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/news_cut/archive/2010/10/what_is_fact-based_analysis.shtml">that is an important discussion to have</a>, but as Kelly McBride at the Pointer Institute noted on <em>Newshour</em>, "<em>NPR</em> has a completely different set of standards for what <em>type</em> of opinion it will tolerate... than <em>Fox News</em> has." (Emphasis added) Williams' firing was caused by his speech and <em>decorum</em> on the Fox News network, not prior restraint against his right to freely express himself.

According to <em>NPR</em>, when Williams appeared on The Factor, he spoke not as just an individual, but as an employee of <em>NPR</em>. Perhaps it is too high a standard to expect journalists to represent their organization regardless of where they open their mouth. But if all organizations held their employees to this standard, perhaps it would make for better news across the industry; perhaps it would foster a healthier, more intelligent, democracy.

So here it is, a collection of audio sampled from across about two months covering the first day of school, a community celebration, and the 54th Anniverssary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Enjoy the audio, and stay tuned here for future entries about dinner parties, education in Hungary, and our upcoming week in Slovenia.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Greg!

I'm a current Gustie, and we are doing an article for the Weekly focusing on the exchange program with China. As a world traveler and a former UIC student, I thought you would have some unique insight! We're on a tight deadline, so if you have time answers before Wed. morning would be great.

*What inspired you to study at UIC?
*What were the most shocking differences between American and Chinese university life?
*How did your trip to China foster the desire to travel more?
*What would you say to students considering studying abroad (particularly in China)?
*How did going to a liberal arts college influence your future?

If you could e-mail responses, I would be SO HAPPY! 

Also, super jealous of your whole adventure! I want to go to eastern Europe so badly!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Given that I came to Hungary about a month and a half after I left Korea, the first question a lot of people ask me is something to the tune of: "So do you like Hungary or Korea better?"<!--more-->

The truth is, the jobs are vastly different, and nearly irreconcilable. I've been struggling with teaching here almost as much as I did there, but the struggles here are of another nature. Here I struggle to reach out to disengaged high schoolers—they exist everywhere, I'm convinced, as do meat-headded jocks, punks searching for meaning in all the wrong places, and lost souls trying to find a niche, each with different characteristics that make them equally difficult to teach. One way this job is similar to the one I left in Korea, however, is the up-hill battle of bringing an American viewpoint on pedagogy into a foreign classroom.

One thing I learned in the last couple weeks is to be perseverant and flexible. I assigned a fairly simple task to my ninth, tenth, and eleventh grade bilingual classes this semester, in part to challenge them to write for a class normally reserved for conversation, but also because one thing I know how to teach is public speaking and presentation of research. The rough draft due date was last week, and I spent the weekend checking them. To my surprise, about 90% of them were copied directly from the sources they cited at the end of the paper, some of them even left the Wikipedia footnotes and hyperlinks in their essay, as if I somehow would not notice; about a quarter of that 90% were not even in paragraph form. Thus was my discovery that my students have never been taught to write structured paragraphs, and that plagiarism often goes unchecked among my students.

"We do it for the other lessons," one student informed me, as I hung my head in disappointment. "It's quick and more efficient that way," another chimed in, "why is <em>that</em> wrong?" They looked at me as if to say, 'obviously doing it quickly and effortlessly is better than wasting time on your assignment.' I then walked them through what they already knew, but refused to admit: the wrongness of taking credit for the work of others.

Following this unfortunate event, I went back to basics, I taught them about topic sentences, and in the next weeks plan to teach them about summarization. At this point, I've shed most of my expectations for this assignment and am hoping the final essays—500 word reports on states and countries—come in plagiarism free.

Someone at training told us to have high expectations for our students. My contact teacher told me to make them write, make them do work. This may have been out of her resentment for the last guy, who according to her did nothing in his classroom, or it may have been real guidance, I have no idea. Regardless, the curriculum I am following is: teach them English, and get them to speak. Pretty vague. I've been exceedingly flexible, and this week I stumbled upon my eureka moment.

Starting on Wednesday my students were assigned the task of solving simple problems using English. They would get a 5 (an A) if they could solve the problem without speaking Hungarian, a 4 if they could not solve the problem, but still only spoke English. As soon as they uttered a word in Hungarian, they received a 3 (a C), and if they could not solve the puzzle speaking Hungarian, a 2. If they did not try at all, a 1. The result was a bell curve skewed toward the 4s and 5s. As the problems get more difficult, I suspect it will normalize around 4. The goal is simple, speak English, and you do well in my class. If they learn something in the process, all the better.

I learned this week that teaching high school is an endless game of tug-of-war. You set out to teach the students something, and they dig in their heels, anchoring themselves to do as little work as possible to win. I'm making progress, however, there was far less resistance to this task than others I tried. Despite extremely simple instructions—try to solve it in English, earn a B—I still had students pushing back. "Can you even give us grades?" one student asked, "solving this problem requires something like maths, what does that have to do with English," another remarked. Teaching, especially abroad, means constantly reevaluating strategies, and finding ways to reach out to the students who give you the hardest time. Working in a foreign system to accomplish it all adds an extra layer of challenge every step of the way.]]></content:encoded>

While on our recent week's vacation to Slovenia, we learned a lot of things about the Slovenes. They are high adventurists, Slovenes can be found doing just about every adrenaline pumping activity on the planet. They are proud of their history, just about everyone we talked to had something to say about the late Yugoslav leader Tito, who ruled the country not with an iron fist, but a pragmatic approach to socialism; it was his leadership that kept the country together, and the absence of it that ultimately led to its demise. Most importantly for this blog post, we learned they are beekeepers. About 1 in every 250 Slovenes <a title="Beekeeping in Slovenia | Government Communication Office" href="http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_room/background_information/culture/beekeeping_in_slovenia/">(or four per thousand)</a> keep a hive for themselves which means in the fancifully quaint city of Bled, population 3,000, there are probably about 12. At the market in Piran, Slovenia's coastal paradise, and in the capital Ljubljana (lyou-bYAHna), we found dozens of varieties of honey.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="640" caption="Honey production has a long history in Slovenia, and apparently this is Slovenia&#39;s oldest bee hive. These movable wooden structures house thousands of bees. Absent minded bees who get so absorbed in visiting flowers they forget their way home have nothing to fear. Each wood panel is painted differently by the bee keepers to help busy bees find their way home, often with snarky images, like the devil sharpening a woman&#39;s tongue. Near Bled, Slovenia."]<a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5151259548_51e4a468b6_z.jpg"><img title="Here little Honey Bee" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5151259548_51e4a468b6_z.jpg" alt="Here little Honey Bee" width="640" height="427" /></a>[/caption]

To be quite honest, before the honey festival here in Kaposvár at the end of September, I didn't think much about the different sources of honey, only that it came from bees. It turns out that honey takes on a multitude of flavors and consistencies depending on what flower it comes from. At the honey festival we sampled many varieties, and in Slovenia decided, since it is such a part of the nation, to buy some real Slovenian honey.

The linden tree has historical significance for Slovenia. Our tour guide in Bled, Tina, told us that back in the day the linden tree and a point of religious significance marked the center of town. The linden tree functioned essentially as a city hall. Around the tree were arranged large stones. During the day the women of the village would gather there to hang laundry and talk, and by evening it became a public forum—mostly populated by men, from the sounds of things—for anyone in the village. The stones signified a seat for each of the village's farms. People would gather under the linden to discuss issues of public importance. As a rhetoric person, I found this wonderful.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="333" caption="After hearing so much about the tradition of bee keeping in Slovenia, we knew we couldn&#39;t head home without some honey weighing down our suit case. In Ljubljana we were overwhelmed by all our choices, and finally committed to a delicious jar of Linden Honey from a small market in Piran, Slovenia. Its flavor packed a tasty punch in a batch of bread. "]<a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5043/5206409986_f3932ca592.jpg"><img title="Linden Honey " src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5043/5206409986_f3932ca592.jpg" alt="Linden Honey " width="333" height="500" /></a>[/caption]

Linden was a natural choice then, for our honey purchase. We could have bought just about any kind of honey one could dream up, but given the political and rhetorical importance, we gave linden honey a shot.

Once we got home I decided that I would attempt to bake with the linden honey. Anyone who follows me online knows I've become something of a bread enthusiast these days. I bake at least one loaf a week, and have been experimenting with different recipes. For our recent Thanksgiving celebration in Budapest, I decided to bake two loaves of bread: a potato bread modified from a recipe at <a title="Baked Potato Bread | The Fresh Loaf" href="www.thefreshloaf.com/recipes/bakedpotatobread">The Fresh Loaf</a>, and something from scratch. The result of my experimenting, a loaf of rye linden baguette. The taste test earned it rave reviews in Budapest this weekend, so if you can find some linden honey, give it a whirl for yourself:

Ingredients:
<ul>
	<li>1 C rye flour</li>
	<li>2 C bread flour</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons instant baking yeast</li>
	<li>1 C water</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1/2 C linden honey</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">Method:</span></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: medium;">Mix together flours, yeast and salt in a bowl. Any bowl will do, just make sure its big enough for the task.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: medium;">Add in the honey and water and mix first with a whisk, then by hand until the dough becomes a single mass.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: medium;">Pour the dough onto a floured countertop and knead for 10-20 minutes (or until your hands get tired). Add more flour (if it's too wet) or water (if it's too dry) if needed. When you are finished kneading the dough should be mostly dry: not sticky enough that it clings, but just enough so that you feel it peel off your hands.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: medium;">Set the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and let rise for as long as you like, but at least until it has doubled in size. Lightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap to keep the moisture inside.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: medium;">Preheat the oven about thirty minutes before you are done letting it rise. 500ºF (260ºC/Gas Mark 9) is a good temp if you're fortunate enough to have an oven with a thermostat. You want the oven hot so you get a nice crunchy crust.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: medium;">Before you throw your loaf in the oven, pour the risen loaf out on a lightly floured counter top and shape it into your loaf. You can shape it however you like, but to get that baguette look, form it into a wide loaf, and fold it over itself. This will cause a gash looking formation that will allow steam to get to the middle of the loaf while it bakes. If you fold it over, pinch the ends of the loaf. You don't want steam escaping, only circulating.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: medium;">Cover your loaf with a moist towel and let it rise again for 20 minutes.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 27px; font-size: medium;">Bake for about 20 minutes, or until it sounds hollow when you tap it with your fingers.</span></li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On our blogs we often reflect on our time abroad; the things that surprise, challenge, and force us into changing our perspective. We offer travel and teaching advice, recipes, and occasionally a post about a dog sneaks in, but what we rarely do is write about our day to day, the things that keep us busy after school, and the things we do to stay in touch with home. Today we offer the latter.

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;">Some of our closer friends, or Twitter followers, may know that Danielle has been writing a monthly column for her hometown newspaper, <a title="The Sun Prairie Star" href="http://www.sunprairiestar.com/">The Sun Prairie Star</a>.</span> Her most recent piece was about the experiences of <a title="Giving thanks in Hungary for new experiences and a taste of home " href="http://www.sunprairiestar.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&amp;SubSectionID=129&amp;ArticleID=6517&amp;TM=10610.75">Sun Prairians living abroad during the holidays</a>. Greg will also be writing outside the Harms-Boone sphere; he was invited to <a title="CheapOair Travel Blogs" href="http://blog.cheapoair.com/">write for the CheapOair.org travel blogs</a>. He is not sure what he will write about yet, or when it will be published, but it will for sure be linked here. <a title="CheapOAir: Cheap flights and airfare" href="http://www.cheapoair.com/">CheapOair</a> is another discount airfare website competing with the likes of Kayak, SkyScanner, and others.

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;">At school, Greg launched the first (ever?) English language newspaper at his high school called <em>The Munkácsy Times</em>. The articles were written by a dedicated, hard-working group of 10th and 11th graders. The first issue dropped this week, and it will be published monthly. A download of the PDF is linked at the bottom of this page. At this point Munkácsy students are required to pay almost a dollar for a color copy of the publication; donations and advertising are accepted by paypal! Greg is also working to organize a web design club, and an East Asian cultures club at Munkácsy High School next semester: did I hear Kimchi making experiment? Send forth your recipes, film recommendations, and anything else you can think of to introduce Central European high school students to East Asia.</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"> </span>Other things that have kept us busy have included wild and crazy adventures to Budapest, coming up with a neat way to visualize our travels and experiences using both the <a title="The Google Maps API Family" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a> and <a title="Protovis: An open source visualization toolkit in javascript" href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/">Protovis</a> (which has included Greg getting a crash course in javascript), baking like crazy, and catching up on some television shows we heard were too good to miss (mostly The Wire, and Dexter). Finally, our friends <a title="Kristin Pederson and Tyler Ray blog about Korea" href="http://prglobal.org">Kristin Pederson and Tyler Ray</a>, who are on their second tour of Korea this time in Daegu, have launched a lovely website, you should visit it and read their blogs about <a title="The World as a Smorgasbord" href="http://prglobal.org/inthekitchen">baking</a> and <a title="The Chosun Chapter" href="http://prglobal.org/ROK">living</a> in South Korea.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seeing as this is a blog written by two travelers who can't seem to write about their destinations fast enough, we thought it would be a good idea to map our travels. Now, you can see all our destinations at once—everywhere we've been in the entire world (though we've been so many places in the motherland that we only included a few), and click on them to learn more information. If there are blog posts about that place, you will see them listed below the place description, and if we happened to snap a photo while we were there, you'll see one of those two. There are still some bugs to be worked out, and any suggestions—style, functionality, or otherwise—are more than welcome either in the comments here or by email. And now, without further ado, we present the map:</p>

<p><a title="The Map: Where in the world Danielle and Greg have visited." href="http://harmsboone.org/extras/map.html">Click here for a map of the places we have visited, and learn more about them.</a></p>

<p>For the curious: The map was generated with the help of the <a title="Learn more about the Google Maps API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps Javascript API V3</a>, no Flash was used to make this map.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past weekend, Kaposvár celebrated the Hungarian tradition of Farsang (far-shaang). The festival featured creatures known as Busó (pronounced boo-show) roaming around Kossuth square, mostly scaring children and dogs, but some also got a bit aggressive with the ladies, which was a little strange. The story of the Buso goes something like this:<!--more-->

Around 1240, Hungary was invaded by the Turks, specifically, they invaded a town called Mohács (Moe-haach). When they arrived, the locals noticed and fled to live in the nearby swamps. Eventually they decided to get rid of the Turks, and they carved up some masks, wrapped themselves in sheep skins, and ran back into town making as much noise as possible in hopes that they would trick the Turks into thinking they were a band of demons, coming to kill them. It worked! Or so the story goes. And the Turks vacated the premises by morning.

Now, what does all this have to do with fair food? We talked about Farsang in my ninth grade class this week and I told them about the Burnsville Fire Muster, the community festival in the city where I grew up, the students pretty unanimously thought the Fire Muster sounded lame. Naturally, I started telling them about the Minnesota State Fair and the all important fair food. I told them about cheese curds, corn dogs, candy bars on a stick, spaghetti and meatballs on a stick, alligator steaks, and others before having them come up with their own ideas for new fair food. I told them I would have some Minnesotans vote for their favorite new fair foods, and report the results back next week. So, without further ado, here is the Munkácsy Mihály Gimnázium 9E class submissions of food to debut at the 2011 Minnesota State Fair, vote for as many as you like:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="427" caption="After a long disznóvágás day, the blood sausage is ready. "]<a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5597108113_057e9c0cb4_z.jpg"><img title="disznóvágás" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5597108113_057e9c0cb4_z.jpg" alt="disznóvágás" width="427" height="640" /></a>[/caption]

On a Friday in late autumn, I walked into my ninth grade bilingual classroom to find an interesting query scrawled across the blackboard. "What is <em>disznóvágás</em> in English?" My command of basic Hungarian pronunciation was still rough around the edges, and as I read the sentence aloud, I mangled the word. I waited for the students to have a good laugh at my expense before I could get a chance to ask, "What exactly is a<em> disznóvágás</em>?" As they explained it to me the first time, I gathered that it was a pig slaughter, but little more.
<!--more-->

"First you catch the pig," one student explained as my imagination pictured him running through the forest in hot pursuit of a wild pig, catching it, and pinning it like a champion wrestler. "Then, kill it and use this thing," he pointed at the Hungarian word written across the board, "to burn the hair away."

"So that thing is called a <em>disznóvágás</em>?" I asked. "That thing is called a blowtorch." I explained to raucous laughter.

The disznóvágás morphed into a sort of meme for that class from that day forward. Students would write pigs into their dialogs and other classroom activities and brainstorm flash mobs relating to pig slaughter rituals. And with each mention, my curiosity grew.

I quickly learned that there was much more to this tradition than simply killing the pig. The slaughter itself is only the beginning, and takes about 90 minutes out of a full day of communal preparation, cooking, and eating. I was determined to attend one. After leaving a string of subtle hints to my students, I abandoned that method, and got more direct. Then I waited. And waited. Just when I was starting to lose heart, a less than conventional invitation found its meandering way to me.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="342" caption="To be honest, I went to the pig slaughter with a little trepidation. I had never seen an animal so big die, and I was worried I would spend the day disgusted and traumatized on the pig&#39;s behalf. There were certainly moments where I turned away, like when the pig was unhappily roused from his sleep, but beyond that I was surprised by how humane the process turned out to be. "]<a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5222/5597088641_9d685e8d76_z.jpg"><img class=" " title="the pig awakens" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5222/5597088641_9d685e8d76_z.jpg" alt="the pig awakens" width="342" height="512" /></a>[/caption]

The disznóvágás started early in the morning. We arrived at the family's home around 6:00, and were greeted by a dog named Scotty—a name that apparently proved difficult for István Veiger, the family patriarch who had turned 81 years old only one day earlier, to pronounce—and István's wife, Erzsébet, or Erzsi for short. Neither Scotty nor Erzsi could speak English, but between Danielle and I our combined Hungarian has improved enough that we were able to answer basic questions about where we were from, how long we had been in Hungary, and most importantly whether we wanted any leftover birthday cake. Obviously, we did.

As we munched on our cake and sipped our coffee we chatted with Erzsi and Pista about our jobs, how we like teaching, and whether the children could behave for us, until Eszter woke up. Eszter Dovigyel was our translator, and the only one who confidently spoke English with us most of the day, a responsibility I suspect her grandmother had sternly assigned. She comes from a long line of teachers: her mother, her aunt, and her grandmother were all teachers, and she is certified for it as well. It was through someone in her family who is friends with one of my students, that we were connected with her and invited to her grandmother's house on Kölcsey street this day.

Another <em>disznóvágás </em>essential, I was told, is <em>pálinka</em>, Hungarian brandy. "Everybody drinks [a] lot of <em>pálinka</em>," the same student told me, with the rest of the class nodding in concurrence, "but not me, of course, only the adults," he grinned. "It's very good."

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="342" caption="Shots of pálinka, Hungary&#39;s liquor of choice, is an essential element of the disznóvágás.

The other family members, a friend of Pista and Erzsi's, and the butcher, Csaba all trickled in during the half an hour Danielle and I sat eating cake and drinking coffee. Eszter introduced everyone in time, and suddenly István walked into the kitchen with a glass jug full of clear liquid and said something about <em>pálinka,</em> "would you like a shot of <em>pálinka</em>," Eszter offered, and just like that I was offered alcohol at the earliest moment of my life: 6:37am. "Egészségedre," we clinked our glasses and before I knew it we were on our way to the killing.

We rolled out, a convoy of cars headed to another house about two minutes away. This is where we would kill the pig.

The first thing we saw was a brown box with 220V printed on its side. It was a transformer plugged into an outlet on the outside of the house leading to what looked like a large pair of lopers made from a garden hose. Attached at the ends were two sponges, and the whole device was wired into the transformer. Before the pig was brought out, the butcher dipped the green shocker into a bucket of water, clipped the ends together to test it. Zap zap, this device, Eszter said would bring the pig to its knees.

The pig was still asleep. The other men had been sent inside the sty to retrieve the proper animal for the day's ritual. When the pig arose it was not happy. It fought for liberation throughout the short journey from its home to the main yard where we were gathered outside, and the green shocker awaited. Once he was in position, Csaba clamped the shocker around its head, just behind the ears. Within seconds it was paralyzed. Silence.

The men carefully laid the pig on its side, one holding the head, the others on its legs. István, still a pro at 81 years old and a day, was crouched down beside its neck with a bowl while the butcher worked a large knife into the pig's neck, slowly bleeding it out. The blood would be saved for blood sausage and "black pudding."

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="640" caption="When all was said and done, 245 kilograms, or a quarter ton. No wonder so many men were at the ready to restrain it. "]<a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5270/5597676092_efa08a6673_z.jpg"><img title="weighing" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5270/5597676092_efa08a6673_z.jpg" alt="weighin" width="640" height="427" /></a>[/caption]

The pig died in about fifteen minutes. It struggled for a while and at one point mustered enough energy to give a kick that toppled István and spilled blood everywhere, but mostly its calm and laborious breathing slowed until it stopped. The men picked it up and moved it to a scale to register its official weight: 245kg, about a quarter ton. Once massed, it was taken near a wood burning stove where a large pot of water boiled, and two large tanks of fuel sat. Csaba grabbed a long horn-like device and with just a spark, the torch roared to life.

The blowtorch seared the hair off the pig's skin, an act that was at once smelly, disgusting, and fascinating. While the butcher braised the skin, the others followed in close after to scrape away what was burned, leaving skin that was clean and ready to process, or simply to eat as István later did.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="333" caption="The pig was nearly ready to be processed into meat that would feed a family for months. "]<a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5597673390_8aca19501c.jpg"><img title="prepping the pig" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5069/5597673390_8aca19501c.jpg" alt="prepping the pig" width="333" height="500" /></a>[/caption]

The pig was then hung from meat hooks attached to an A-frame structure that would give Csaba some leverage to hoist the pig up, and allow access to the insides. The head was long gone by this point, stored away in one of the cars.

It soon became clear to us that the only parts of the pig unfit for consumption were the eyes and inner ear, which were thrown at Danielle upon their extraction. Once Csaba cut into the torso, everything was saved. István definitely had the worst job at this point. After cutting out the stomach, it was his job to void the intestines of whatever remained prior to the pigs sudden, quiet death. Getting within a meter of István was all it took to add another scent to the list of things I hoped to never smell again. The other organs were separated and contained. The enormous liver and kidneys, the heart and lungs. The last part, after the body cavity was organ-free was to cut out the fat.

Some of the animal's fat was attached to a muscle, like the ribs, kidney, neck, etc., but the bulky stuff, the stuff of which lard is made is in the cavity, padding and insulating the organs. This too was saved.

The final step in butchering is to split the body at the spine. My students told me later that this <em>must </em>be done with a hatchet. It was the quickest part of the whole affair. With a few whacks of the blade it was over, and we headed home.

Most of my students thought the idea of a foreigner attending a pig killing was bizarre enough, but enjoying it was right out risible; the first thing my students did when I said I attended this killing, without fail, was laugh out loud. Some were stumped as to why someone would willingly subject themselves to watching an animal be killed and have its organs harvested. It is, however, something every carnivore should be subjected to at some point. There is a lot of talk these days about not eating this that or the other thing because its made from this that or the other part of an animal. Hot dogs, for example, are made from pig anus, but when it really comes down to eating an animal, what does it matter what part you are eating as long as it is safely and healthily prepared? The best sausage I've had was stuffed in this pig's intestine. Most sausage probably is stuffed in intestine; does that make it gross or sustainable. Is eating intestine really that much more revolting than muscle? It's a bit disingenuous to savor a tenderloin and at the same time refuse to eat an organ.

To be sure there is certainly something to be said for knowing what is in your food and where it came from, and how healthy it may not be, but outright anatomy discrimination is none of those things. Antibiotics and chemicals that make the animal nearly invulnerable, or preserve whatever you are eating, or add extra flavor or color to the food, these are all legitimate reasons not to eat something, just as knowing what goes on in a feed lot or processing facility is. This is the paramount element of a <em>disznóvágás: </em>there is no question about how your pork went from oink to plate. You know where it ate, slept, what it ate, and what if any antibiotics it was fed. You also get to participate, first hand, in turning it into food, watching and sometimes helping every step of the way.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="333" caption="It turns out a quarter ton pig yields a lot of meat. "]<a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5185/5597685628_f288e31d36.jpg"><img title="Meat" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5185/5597685628_f288e31d36.jpg" alt="Meat" width="333" height="500" /></a>[/caption]

The rest of the day was spent rendering the pig for consumption. The bulkier chunks of fat were hung to dry, which gave them a strange soapy feeling. Ribs and other bones were split into reasonably sized pieces of meat, fat was cut from the muscles and sent to the kitchen where it would be cubed and turned into lard. Bones were sawed, and food was made. While the butcher and Eszter's cousin focused on separating the meat, István was preparing the sausage components that included the lungs, heart, and kidneys, and the women cooked lunch.

Lunch included a stew that was made from brain and liver (it's also good on toast, we were told), and the best rib meat I've ever tasted. And of course, more <em>pálinka</em> and wine, which were also homemade, by István. On the wall behind the dining table were numerous awards and distinctions his wine and pálinka had acquired over the years. One wine we had was a semi-dry white with a peculiar sour taste, almost like a green apple. He appreciated my appetite for his házi italok, and I his generosity.

After lunch a pan that was probably 8 inches deep and wide enough to cover all 4 of the stove's burners was filled with near equally sized cubes of fat, and set on to boil. Meanwhile, the guys made sausage. Exactly which organs went into the sausage wasn't clear, but most of the remaining ones went first into a grinder and then into a large tub, the kind you might use to move your life across the country. Several heads of garlic, and cup upon cup of paprika powder and other spices were mixed by hand before being dropped like giant meatballs into the sausage suffer. The butcher worked the intestine cum sausage wrap while Eszter's cousin pressed the mixture through. Minutes later several kilos of sausage hung from a rack under some stairs. This would be enough to last this family for most of the year after it is smoked for a few weeks. The best part of this, for them, is that they'll not have to go to the butcher's this year, at least not for a while.

Inside the house, the fat set out to boil was beginning to fill the room with the aroma of cooking bacon. It was as if someone had been making BLTs all morning. The fat was nearly finished boiling when it looked like dried fruit, shriveled and soaking in the grease it excreted as it heated up. The grease was then poured into a large cone where it would cool into lard. After all was done, the cubes were served as an afternoon snack with bread. Tepertő, it was called.

We left shortly after snack time, but not without four links of freshly stuffed <em>hurka,</em> blood sausage. Apart from the photos sounds and memories, this sausage was our sole souviner for our day; a deep grey colored edible we roasted over potatoes and consumed in a manner of days. It was possibly the tastiest sausage I've consumed.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="I wondered why they had promptly hung two huge hunks outside in the cold. Then when they pushed the hardened chunks into the meat grinder, I understood. I&#39;m still not quite sure what they did with all of it, though I have no doubt that all of it was used. "]<a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5107/5597107381_680ac0c146.jpg"><img title="Pig fat" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5107/5597107381_680ac0c146.jpg" alt="Pig fat" width="500" height="333" /></a>[/caption]

Eating food this fresh makes it easy to understand people who disrespect seafood in inland places: the Alaskans who say salmon "doesn't taste good," in Minnesota, or sushi enthusiasts who fear it if they are too far from a coast. But while I better understand these sentiments, and doubt I will ever again use the word delicious to describe a frozen pork chop from Cub Foods, I'm not such a purist that I'll now only eat freshly butchered pork and bemoan every occasion I am forced to choke down anything else. Going forward however, I will never be able to consume pork without thinking about the <em>disznóvágás</em> and the practical, ritualized way in which an animal was turned into a year's worth of food in just under half a day, and the knowledge that this method is a vastly different process than any employed by the behemoth food companies in the states. Back home, and throughout the more developed parts of the world—even increasingly here in Hungary—we like to keep a sturdy barrier between our plates and the farm. Consequently, we as consumers often know very little about how an animal becomes food. This should change. We deserve to experience these kinds of things—to be able to buy a bushel of corn from the farmer who grew it, or a slab or ribs from the farm that raised the pig. Sadly that barrier is solid and institutionalized, engrained into our legal code for various, misguided reasons. For now, I still have the disznóvágás.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks ago I created <a title="A wiki for CETP" href="http://cetp.harmsboone.org" target="_blank">a wiki for the CETP program</a> in hopes that CETP participants would share experiences and words of wisdom about their homes and schools in Hungary. So far few have taken up the cause, and I suspect it has something to do with time. Updating a wiki about the place you've lived for nearly a year, not to mention working with the MediaWiki interface takes a certain amount of energy. In fact, I haven't even had time to make one about Kaposvár or my school and it was my idea! To solve this problem, I endeavored to pass along the burden of typing up all the important information about my school, town, and Hungary to my students, <a title="Munkácsy Mihály Gimnázium Wiki" href="http://cetp.harmsboone.org/wiki/Munkacsy_Mihaly_Gimnazium" target="_blank">a task that was recently partially completed</a>.<!--more-->

The idea of a wiki was not new to any of my students. When we did state and country reports last semester, many of them handed in entire essays copied longhand from the free encyclopedia, Wikipedia. Most of them knew the idea, I doubt, however, that any of them had actually written a wiki before. As writers go they were not great, but they could write a wiki and practice never hurts. Plus, with a wiki they will have a chance to edit each other and collaborate on the assignment. The idea of creating original content on the Internet, however, I suspected was something new to them.
<h2>Creating Experts</h2>
The wiki lessons constituted a good chunk of time, especially considering I only see each group of students between once and three times a week, it was a six day project, but with homework assignments it could be condensed down to three or four. The first day was spent priming the students for the next few weeks.

The idea of the CETP Wiki was to have good quality information available about places that rarely see tourists, even from within Hungary; places with sometimes fewer than 1,000 people living there that our organization places new teachers in each year. Other places are more like Kaposvár, under 100,000 but far from a booming metropolis. Googling some of the places returns little more than a map and directory listings for some businesses, even their Wikipedia entries are scant if existent. The best people to talk about these places are the people who live there.

To prove to my students they were experts on their subjects, I had them imagine they were participating in the American Field Service (AFS). They were first to imagine what kinds of things they would want to know about Mankato, MN, where they would spend the next year living and going to school far from the comforts of home. After that they were to make a list of things they would be sure to tell an AFS student that was moving to Kaposvár.

The next days were spent brainstorming and organizing thoughts about the three subject areas: <a title="Munkácsy Mihály Gimnázium (Kaposvár)" href="http://cetp.harmsboone.org/wiki/Munkácsy_Mihály_Gimnázium_(Kaposvár)" target="_blank">Munkácsy High School</a> for the ninth graders, <a title="Kaposvár" href="http://cetp.harmsboone.org/wiki/Kaposvár" target="_blank">Kaposvár</a> for the eleventh graders, and <a title="Hungary" href="http://cetp.harmsboone.org/wiki/Hungary" target="_blank">Hungary</a> for the twelfth graders. This is the part that could be substituted for homework, but <a title="Tales of a Gimnazium Lektor: Part One" href="http://harmsboone.org/tales-of-a-gimnazium-lektor-part-one" target="_blank">given my experience with homework assignments in the past</a>, I decided it all had to be done in class if I wanted it done. Days two and three were spent first on idea webs, then on outlining those webs, and then I assigned a topic to each group based on where their outlines were strongest. Day four we spent writing rough drafts on the topics I assigned. Finally, on days five and six we were in the lab.
<h2>Lab Day One</h2>
My school had at least three computer labs, none of which had enough computers for every student, and as I learned today, only some of which were connected to the Internet, and the labs I have access to for this project also did not have a teacher's computer connected to a projector, so showing the students what their screen was supposed to look like was out of the question. Luckily, each class only had four or five groups, so keeping them on the same page (literally) was not too much of a challenge.

The only hiccup was that my first class was locked out of the system, so I instead had them write up their wiki entry on MS Word and then email it to me, and then I manually updated their pages for them. I had the next class write up their entry in Word and then copy and paste them into their group's User: page.
<h2>Lab Day Two</h2>
The second day in the lab we spent editing. The first lab was suffering from a cripplingly slow Internet connection that made it difficult for some groups to sign in to the wiki, but once that was resolved, it went pretty smoothly. Each group was assigned to edit another group's page. Once they were finished they were to copy and paste their edited section to the Munkácsy Mihály Gimnázium page. At the end of the day all the sections were added to the page, and it looked like it had come straight out of wikipedia.

Once they were all finished there was a short self-evaluation each group was to complete on their user's talk page. It asked simple questions like: How much English did you speak? Could you have spoken more English? Did you follow the directions? Did you work as hard as you could? and What Mark do you think you earned? Their answers to these questions were taken into consideration when I graded their work.
<h2>Assessment</h2>
The assignment had two primary goals. First, to encourage the students to think broadly about their community. For the students writing about Kaposvár their instinctive advice to the hypothetical AFS student was almost universally "don't come here." I'm sure there was a time when that would have been my reaction to the question, "what would you tell someone thinking about moving to Burnsville, MN?" and the point of this assignment was to teach the students that that is neither a helpful nor acceptable answer to that question.
The second goal was to get the students collaborating on something creative. The wiki environment is partiuclarly attractive for this because it allows students to easily go to another article and edit someone elses work, leaving behind a comprehensible log of changes for their peers to interpret.

In assessing student work, the highest mark was a five, which represented a perfect work, free of any grammatical or spelling mistakes, but a five also represented a group that worked together, including every member of the team every step of the way. They were assessed both on the quality of their original assignment and on the mistakes they were able to spot while they were editing.

The universal goal of all assignments in a conversational English class was also at play in the wiki project, namely, that the students should be able to communicate with each other well enough in English that they can work through a complicated problem without using their mother tongue. At the beginning of the term all my students were told that they could only get a 5 if they spoke English exclusively from the moment I walked into the room until class was dismissed. This assignment was no different, a group could only earn a 5 if every member completed all tasks speaking only English. The resulting distribution was focused highly around 4, a good mark, but not perfect, with a few groups earning a 4/5, or a strong 4, and a couple groups earned a 3. All groups successfully passed the assignment.

In addition to the group grade, each student was given an individual participation grade each day of the assignment. Again, students could only earn a 5 for the day if they were on task, speaking English, and following directions, and here again most students earned 4s.
<h2>Next Step</h2>
The Wikis for my 11th and 12th classes are still in the works, and will be for quite some time. I teach teach these classes only once per week and spring break adds an extra two weeks to the timeline. We'll be back in the lab again in May, and the pages for Kaposvár and Hungary will be produced then.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wherein a Northfield Game Inspired a Lesson Plan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[People who came of age in the State of Minnesota sometime in the last decade likely have heard of <a title="Tricadecathlonomania: Official Website" href="http://trica.clockworkdistractions.com" target="_blank">Tricadecathlonomania</a>, particularly those of us who know someone Northfield. For anyone who hasn't heard of it,  Trica, as it's commonly known, is a scavenger hunt of epic proportion. It is not the scavenger hunt where you find a big list of things and bring them back to whomever gave you the list, nay it is far greater than that. With a whopping 288 items on the 2010 list, Trica is perhaps the most ambitious type of scavenger hunt there is; and here's the catch: the list, whatever of it you can manage, must be completed in 24 hours. Thus was born "Tricadecathlonomania: The Lesson Plan."

The weather here in Hungary, simply put, has been gorgeous lately. The Magyars must have settled in this ancient ocean in April or May because I can't imagine a better time to mosey on through the Magyarföld. Consequently, I was pestered nearly every lesson, every day, to go out to the park, have class outside, or play some kind of game. At first I was unsure if it was allowed, or if I should just stay on the Munkácsy property, or if it was allright to go to the nearby Berzsenyi Park. It turns out it is perfectly okay, so the only thing I needed to dream up was what to do once we got there. Then, it dawned on me. Students. Giant park. Nice weather. The conditions were perfect for a scavenger hunt. I contemplated different ways of doing it and ultimately settled on Trica style.

For the purposes of keeping things easy, I decided only to pit the students against their class mates, though in retrospect, a pan-bilingual program Trica game would have been more exciting. Each lesson then broke into 3-5 teams, each team got a <a title="Trica: The lesson list" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SypMFtcIqUtPEDiTptFBwAE6rMfbnK8MrR1KKpY0eFE/edit?hl=en_US" target="_blank">list</a> and once they ha a list there were off. They had until our next lesson to earn as many points as possible. The only rules:
<ol>
	<li>Items must be documented with either a photo or video.</li>
	<li>Points were only valid if they were earned inside a specific playing area (this was to keep the students from wandering too far during the lesson).</li>
	<li>No breaking laws or school rules.</li>
	<li>All language in the videos and photos must be in English. Any Hungarian—spectators commenting, little kids running into the video, signs in the background—will void the item.</li>
	<li>Breaking rules no. 2-4 may result in a disqualification (and a mark 1).</li>
</ol>
The students were amazingly engaged with the idea from the start. Chuckles arose while they were reading over the list, many of the items were borrowed from the 2010 Trica list, and were quite vague, strange, or seemingly impossible. Two such items perplexed almost all the groups:
<blockquote>6. Ask about the current euro to forint exchange rate at a bank, and then whip out a gyro to trade in. [40] (Bonus if said gyro is produced from a briefcase you’re handcuffed to [25])

30. A partridge in a pear tree, 2 turtle doves, 3 French hens, 4 calling birds, 5 golden rings, 6 geese a laying, 7 swans a swimming, 8 maids a milking, 9 ladies dancing, 10 lords a leaping, 11 pipers piping, 12 drummers drumming. [30 per verse/item]</blockquote>
None of the teams attempted no. 6, there was only one bank within the playing area, so it may have been too hard. It also didn't help that in Hungarian "gyro" is spelled "gyros" and pronounced "ghee-rhoss" and Euro is pronounced nothing like that in Hungarian. No. 30 confused almost all the groups, apparently the 12 Days of Christmas carol isn't as popular here—though one group earned a whopping 360 points for doing all 12 by bringing in a video tape of a 12 Days cartoon—either that or all the groups were giving it way too much though.

In all it was among the most fun I've ever had teaching, certainly the most fun I've had since September.

Videos of some of the points coming soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why I&#039;m (still) Excited about Google+</title>
		<link>http://www.harmsboone.org/why-im-still-excited-about-google</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It wasn't until the Facebook/Skype marriage that I remembered Google were tackling a new social service. Eventually I got into the system to give it a spin and I have to say I'm impressed. I'm not quite ready to ditch Facebook, or say that anybody should or will ditch Zuck &amp; Co.'s popular if addled monster, but I am impressed. Apparently the fifth try is the charm.

To be sure, Google+ is still lacking one major feature: people. The trial period means that not every Snodgrass@gmail.com can sign up for an account. But bear in mind that when Facebook launched it also lacked people, almost pretentiously so, and people still used it. In Facebook's early days anybody without an email address ending .edu and any school where Facebook "wasn't yet available," were sure out of luck until Zuckerberg opened things up. What Google lacks in population (<a title="Google+ Hits 10 Million Users" href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/07/google-hits-10-million-users-should-facebook-freak-out/39854/" target="_blank">though if it keeps up these growth rates, it could well have solved that problem soon</a>) it more than makes up for in user experience by providing G+ users with a natural, easy, and safe way to connect with each other.

For the Google power user, G+ is a true winner because of it's subtle but effective integration across all Google's apps. Android users will also love the Google+ App available free in the Market which blows away both Twitter and Facebook's respective apps. It's best feature is clearly Instant Upload which posts images to G+ as you snap them. Instant uploads go into a private space where users may easily push them out to their circles.

The biggest advantage for the everyday user is Circles. It is important to consider what Google are actually doing with G+. They are not simply redoing Facebook.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="535" caption="xkcd&#39;s concise take on Google+"]<a href="http://xkcd.com/918/"><img title="xkcd: Google+" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/googleplus.png" alt="It's like Facebook, but not Facebook!" width="535" height="281" /></a>[/caption]

G+ is a rethinking of the way our social relationships can be simulated or visualized on the Internet. Ironically, it's the same idea that launched Facebook so many years ago.

Before Facebook there was the loud and creepy MySpace. Signing up for Facebook was refreshing. Everyone's profile looked the same, save for the profile picture and responses to some standard details. Facebook was focused where MySpace was chaotic. Connect to friends and keep appraised of whatever parts of their personal life they want to share. As the site grew Zuck &amp; Co. added more and more features, and eventually opened things up to the whole world.

What Facebook missed, however, was that people want to connect with their friends, but also people who aren't really friends.

Eventually Facebook added a way to keep your friends in groups and set up a complicated system for deciding who gets to see what by default. But these groups are still groups of friends. An organization chart of Facebook would have a giant Friends box on the top, with arrows coming out of it pointing to groups; anything you share gets sent to your friends, and then filtered into the appropriate groups. Things get dicey here with eg. teacher-student and employer-employee relationships. It may be a good thing for students to be connected to teachers on Facebook, but are they really friends? It'd be great to connect with superiors at work, but are they really friends? G+ says no.

Everyone has social circles. Work circles, friend circles, school circles, bowling league circles, political circles, apolitical circles, <em>ad infinitum</em>. There is often overlap among these circles. In the G+ organization chart, there is no big box, but a series of Venn diagrams; when things are shared, they go directly to the appropriate circle, and nowhere else. When a user wants to connect with someone, they choose right away which circle they go into. This is how we think about the people we know in real life. In short, Facebook is a Rolodex, Google+ is a visualization of your scene.

G+ has the best privacy controls of any social application on the web today. Twitter is straightforward: everything you post is either shared with everyone, or only the people you allow; you're either all in or not. Facebook is too complicated to summarize in one sentence without long-winded independent and parenthetical clauses (that's a double-dog dare). G+ users decide on every post who gets to see it and who doesn't. While setting a default (from public, like Twitter, to private, meaning just you, and everything in between) is possible, Google have made it incredibly easy to decide on the fly. And it isn't hard to see the benefits. Circles allows users to be more like curators, or focused conversationalists rather than forcing them to be broadcasters. And it works both ways, users control whose posts they see by cycling through circles, so if someone in a user's circles is being too noisy, there's always the ability to create the "isolation chamber" circle.

The <a title="Facebook's Big Wake-Up Call" href="http://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2011/07/13/facebooks-google-plus-social-networking/">Wall Street Daily</a> was right when they called Circles "Google’s answer to Facebook’s clumsy 'groups' feature." Circles is seamless, natural and is at the foundation of Google+. It's a great way to share. Some are starting to see some <a title="Google's new social network: Circles and the Efficiency/Serendipity Trade Off" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/07/googles-new-social-network?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/circlesandthetradeoff">disadvantages with this kind of forced manual sorting</a>, that the inherent segmentation may actually lead to less interesting online interactions, but in general Circles seems to be the best answer to the online privacy problem so far. If you want everyone and anyone to weigh in on a question, and if you want to see everything and anything shared with you, that is all still possible. But when you know there is something not everyone should see, G+ has your back.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hacking as Protest?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I posted this question to my Google+ contacts earlier this morning, but decided it was worth blogging about too.

The recent protests against SanFrancisco's BART system is raising all kinds of eyebrows over a government authority's silencing of mobile networks in the interest of  public safety. The bushiest of those eyebrows: didn't Mubarak do exactly the same thing when he was trying to silence pro-democratic riots in Egypt, and isn't that guy in a cage on trial right now, and doesn't this remind anyone of a certain book titled with the year Reagan was reelected? While comparing BART's suppression of cell networks underground to Mubarak's silencing of all Internet and telephonic communication in the entire country of Egypt is a stretch, it does follow that if citizens are content to allow a small government agency to shut off our communication systems in the name of possible threats to public safety, it would be hard for those citizens to complain about a bigger agency doing the same thing. It sets a dangerous precedent.

The people of SanFrancisco had the right to protest BART's action, and <a title="Anonymous Protest Turns Tumultuous" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/anonymous-protest-ends-quietely/?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=tha26">protest they did</a>. The hacker group Anonymous even got in on the action, showing up, as they did in DC recently, wearing Guy Fawkes masks and joined in the fun of shutting down the metro stations around downtown SFO.

The eyebrow I raised after reading the <em>Times's</em> report (linked above) about the protests, was Anonymous's hacking of myBART.org, a "web site for BART riders," wherein they "leaked the names, phone numbers and passwords of many of the site’s users." What's puzzling to me about this, is why a friend of the cause would intentionally do harm to its own people.

Yes what BART did was wrong. Yes anonymous have the right to protest; I'm even inclined to say they have the right to hack the myBART website as a means of protest. But how effective a protest is it to release data of innocent civilians? It seems the worst kinds of protests are the ones where the leaders intentionally put the supporters at greater risk. For example, if my bank came under fire and someone hacked the bank and released my account numbers, address, user name and password, it would be hard to think, "those dudes are on my side."

Then again, maybe compromised data is the new risk of protesting; the 21st equivalent of getting arrested for sitting at a lunch counter. That would be like MLK arresting the people for the police, or directing the fire hoses. Most people knew it was a possibility going into the protests, but in the civil rights movement, when people were arrested it reinforced the movement's legitimacy.

A while ago <a title="Weak Ties Build Movements" href="http://harmsboone.org/weak-ties-build-movements">I railed against Malcolm Gladwell's</a> argument that social movements require "huge sacrifices" in order to be successful, and that the lack of sacrifices in online social movements is proof that "the revolution will not be tweeted." Is this the "huge sacrifice" people will be required to make, that if you protest you risk having any data connected to the institution you are protesting against compromised? Weigh in, share your thoughts in the comments.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Fantastic inquiries, Greg, and intriguing questions I think.  In answer to your final question I would say that yes, the possibility of essential data being outed is a sacrifice people need to be aware of and willing to make when they opt into any kind of system, be it a bank, transit system, etc.  It's unfortunate that a certain amount of opting in is pretty much essential in today's world, ie one must have a social security number that is used as identification in any number of situations if you want to live any way other than completely off the grid.  No one should be deluded that participation in the public sphere is inherently safe, at least in regards to the lockdown of shared information.  I think the American public has been sorely misled as to the nature of the information web in the present age, and education on conscious consumption and conveyance of information is essential.

However, I think it is also up to the public to hold protesters like Anonymous accountable to exactly what you criticize: releasing date of innocent civilians.  I would challenge those innocent civilians to demand that hackers and protesters alike explain the intention and benefit behind releasing that kind of information to the world.

		<title>Bring on the Good Beers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Andre Francisco at <a title="Just a Rough Draft" href="http://justaroughdraft.com">Just a Rough Draft</a> (and recently at <a title="Project on Government Oversight" href="http://pogo.org">POGO</a> as well) and I could drone on for hours lamenting a common and serious problem with fine dining establishments: the beer list. It is all too common for restaurants to have extensive wine lists, and servers knowledgable about which wines will pair well with which dishes, but have only rancid, tasteless mass market brews like Heineken, Budweiser and Miller Genuine Draft in bottles at ridiculous prices. Beer remains for many restaurants a cheaper, less sophisticated drink, when there are many beers crafted with just as much care and sophistication as a vinter puts into an expensive wine.

To illustrate, Danielle and I lunched at <a title="Ristorante Piccolo" href="http://www.piccolodc.com/">Ristorante Piccolo</a> in Georgetown as part of <a title="Restaurant Week 2011" href="http://restaurantweekmetrodc.org/default.asp">DC's Restaurant Week</a>. The food was delicious, and all the beverages expensive. House Wine was $8, and while there were several pages of reds, whites, rosés and champagnes, there were eleven beers on the entire menu. Among them were two Italian lagers, Miller Lite, and a healthy offering from InBev and SABMiller, all between $6-8 for a bottle. This is absurd. It's like selling boxed wine for $6 a glass, and Three Buck Chuck for $8; no wine drinker would tolerate that. At Piccolo they even misspell the name of their best beer, Sam Adams as "Sam Adam," it may seem like a small detail, but it's but one in a collection of double standards and gourmet oversights.

More than the selection of beer, the presentation at these restaurants is also upsetting. While wines at these restaurants are typically delivered in the correct glass, beers are delivered in a pint glass, the same one they serve in college bars and greasy spoons. Here again, a double standard. For wine it is important for the glass to facilitate the wine's flavor, a glass acceptable for wine drinkers; for beer, just some glass.

<a href="http://harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-Shot-2011-08-24-at-6.05.44-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1167" title="Screen Shot 2011-08-24 at 6.05.44 PM" src="http://harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-Shot-2011-08-24-at-6.05.44-PM-512x223.png" alt="" width="512" height="223" /></a>That tweet from Andre above pretty much sums up this whole post. Imagine a server dumping wine from the bottle into a glass, aerating it all over the place, maybe even dribbling a little on the table cloth, and in the wrong glass to boot. They would be gone faster than you could say, "Careful, man, there's a beverage here!" Yet beer gets treated like Coca-Cola: something people drink when they don't like, or can't drink wine.

A tripel should be served in a goblet. They look fancy because they are fancy. <a title="Trippin' on Tripels" href="http://beeradvocate.com/articles/223 — BeerAdvocate">As BeerAdvocate's Alström Bros say</a>, the Tripel is "a pretty damn fascinating style of beer to say the least. If crafted and served correctly, it is a beverage of great awe." They are brewed in a specific kind of monastery in Belgium called a "Trappist," and by law only Trappists may brew it. Typically are extraordinarily alcoholic—think 10%—because they are brewed with three times (get it, triple?) the amount of malt normally used in an ale.

For all the same reasons why its important to serve wine properly it is also important to serve beer properly. The average drinker might not tell the difference between an India Pale Ale and an Extra Pale Ale, but an informed palate will be able to distinguish not just between the different types, but what makes one brewery's IPA better than others. Every part of the brew process influences the flavor of the beer, and not just the ingredients, but also how they are used. The shape of the glass, and the temperature it is served at can sometimes greatly alter a beer's flavor, just like wine.

This is not to say there are not places to get a good brew. There are, in many cities around the world, excellent restaurants with gourmet food and beers to match. For <a title="DC Beer Week 2011" href="http://dcbeer.com/dcbeerweek/">DC Beer Week</a> (the same week as Restaurant Week) Andre, Danielle and I ventured out to Big Hunt in Dupont Circle and enjoyed half price bombers. We also went to Churchkey where we all shared a pint of Heavy Seas's Siren Noire, a stout that tastes like the best hot chocolate I've ever had and the best bourbon I've yet to have, folded gently into an amazingly heavy and smooth stout. A must try for anyone jumping into the specialty beer foray.

No, this is just to say, that with the explosion of craft brewing across this country there are more and more people going to restaurants these days who know the difference between good and bad beers. Given the price difference, there may actually be more of us than people who can tell from wines, and it's time restaurants gave the beer drinkers a decent option. Brewers know this, beer drinkers know it, it's time the chefs started to pay attention. So, bring on the good beer.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We added a new blog this week, this one will be mostly me, but Danielle might weigh in occasionally. I'm sure she'll have her own blog that I'll probably not contribute much to in good time. For now, we give you all 202 Bikes and Brews, <a title="202 Bikes and Brews: A Blog from Harms-Boone Productions" href="http://harmsboone.org/blog/bikes-n-brews">http://harmsboone.org/blog/bikes-n-brews</a>, a blog about my two nearest and dearest hobbies as of late: biking and brewing. There's a lot to write about both, and I have some stary-eyed ambitions about both for the next few years. (Did you know it's possible to bike from here to Pittsburgh <a title="Bike Directions from DC to Pittsburgh, PA" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=N+Quinn+St,+Arlington,+VA+22209&amp;daddr=Pittsburgh,+PA&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=39.667028,-78.535767&amp;spn=1.868952,4.22699&amp;sll=39.669375,-78.534495&amp;sspn=1.868895,4.22699&amp;geocode=FQh2UQId4t9n-ynv3ucxXra3iTELbtjYtvUpSQ%3BFTETaQIdElw7-ykDhQZIb_E0iDE0G6JaoRX5jQ&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;dirflg=b&amp;mra=ltm&amp;z=9&amp;lci=bike">almost exclusively on bike trail</a>?)

Apart from adding the new blog, I condensed the menus down a bit, glomming Keeping up with the Magyars and Schoolhouse: ROK under "Travel Blogs" and adding the new one to the list. A design refresh is on the way, though I'm not sure how long it's going to take me. Cafés are a lot more expensive out here and we didn't get]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mount Vernon: An Ode to Dedicated Trails</title>
		<link>http://www.harmsboone.org/mount-vernon-an-ode-to-dedicated-trails</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple weeks ago Danielle and I joined a couple of my new classmates on a ride out to Mount Vernon. The beautiful trail winds its way along the Potomac from the Washington estate past Alexandria, where it is briefly interrupted, DCA , the National Cemetery, and Fort Meyers, terminating finally in Rosslyn at the Key Bridge. Almost all of it is off-street trail much like what I was used to in Minneapolis. In general it is quite a nice trail; smooth pavement, except for some boardwalks here and there, beautiful scenery (can't get much better than the monuments), even a place where you can get so close to landing aircrafts that you can almost touch them. With all that, though, the trail lacks some surprising features I've seen other places.

Most prominently in Lake Park, Korea, exist speed-segregated trails. All the way around the lake were walking paths, "fast walking" or running paths, and bike or really fast running paths. Even when the paths converged, they did so only in that there was no physical barrier between the three; occasionally the walking and running paths would join forces. In a park as busy as Lake Park was, it was hard to imagine not having these trails separated out. Even during the slow periods there were dozens of people sharing the path with you, after all it was the biggest, and only real outdoor recreation area for a city of a million. Sure there were other bike paths, but they almost all pass through the park at some point, and if you are terrified of the traffic on the streets (as I should have been) Lake Park is the longest stretch of uninterrupted trail. The segregated trails exist back home, too, in Minneapolis.

Though not so rigid as the Ilsanite park, the Minneapolitan Grand Rounds Scenic Byway is almost all split into "wheeled traffic" and "biped" traffic. There are signs around the lakeshore bike trails telling walkers, "If you don't have wheels under your feet, you're on the wrong trail." It's a friendly convenience both to bikers and pedestrians. The trails are supposed to be speed limited to 10mph, but even at that speed, crashing into a walker or runner who can't hear you shout "left side!" is going to do some damage to someone. Thus the separation allows bikers to only worry about slow pokes weaving around the bikeway in a carelessly unpredictable manner with iPods loudly obstructing their hearing, and there is almost always an opportunity to safely pass such nuisance bikers.

On the Vernon trail there is no segregation, a perfect union where all ambulation is created equal, with no special treatment or exclusion. Want to walk very slowly down the middle of the path with headphones on so you can't hear people telling you to get out of your way? Go for it! This is America, you have that right. And so, I make my first argument in favor of segregation, but only as it applies to speed and mode of travel. It is not as though there is no space for a second two-way trail for walkers. Throughout most of the Mt. Vernon Trail there is plenty of room for separate trails, and the congestion certainly merits it. As an example of the benefits, I present my experience riding this weekend.

For some reason Saturday was the day everyone decided to wander aimlessly down the trail without really paying attention to their surroundings. I was coming up quickly behind a runner who had headphones on and shouted "left side!" from a good distance. Her reaction was to stop in her tracks and say, "where, what side!?" I'm not sure how she could be confused by "left side." A reasonable person should assume the person saying it is behind (answering the "where"), and coming up on the left side (answering the "what side") and then get to the right, or at least not be spooked by the biker whizzing past. To her credit, at least she heard me, dozens of others think it is perfectly acceptable to throw in the headphones and tune everything out, as the old Atmosphere line goes, "put my headphones on for this world I ignore."

Bikers can shout "left side" at these people all we want but they won't hear us, and sometimes will get spooked, and if they do something dangerous (like stop, or move to the left instead of the right) someone could get hurt. The point is, with segregated trails this shouldn't happen, or is at least limited to the few points where trails merge or biped traffic meandering onto the wrong trail.

Washington and Arlington are great places to bike, but especially during busy times and around tourist attractions (which are everywhere in this town) the trails can become overly congested and therefore inconvenient and dangerous. I suspect it will be a long time before it happens, but I hope there are plans for expanding the trails around here to separate the wheeled from the non-wheeled.]]></content:encoded>

<p>Steve Jobs was a great man who invented some amazing devices that have changed the way we interact with technology. Today we've changed our look, (inspired by boingboing.net) to a retro mac theme in his memory. I never knew Jobs, and never thought I'd get the chance, but he was an inspiring public speaker, an innovator, and a businessman not afraid to make insanely great products. His genius, his commitment to greatness, near perfection and thinking different, left a mark on global technology and industrial design that will far outlast his mortality.</p>

<p>Thanks, Steve. Rest in Peace.</p>

<p>Stay Hungry.</p>

<p>The age of the state is not over. Though some have written about the power of web 2.0 to topple regimes and destroy state sovereignty, the picture is a little more complicated. The Republic of Korea in the last two decades has taken on a major cultural export campaign. Led by television dramas and pop music, the “Korean Wave,” as it’s called, has strengthened the ROK’s position as a regional power. More recently, the Republic of Korea started a comprehensive online public diplomacy campaign targeted specifically outside Korea’s ordinary sphere of influence with the goal of developing soft power abroad. Through an examination of tourism statistics, public opinion polls, and Google search trends, this paper ask the question: what if any soft power was generated by these online efforts? The results, though not immediately obvious, provide an early model for a state successfully taking on the new challenges posed by information and communication technologies to generate soft power online. <a href="#pdf">Download this article as a PDF.</a> This paper was prepared as part of a course taught by Shanthi Kalathil at Georgetown University.

<strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>The age of the state is not over. Though some might enjoy thinking the state will succumb to the power of the Internet, “the state still matters,” Joseph Nye said in a 2010 TED Talk, “but the stage is crowded…” (Nye 2010). Not long ago, communicating at the rates and distances possible today cost fortunes only major institutions could afford. Today communication is cheap, fast, and accessible. A myriad of public voices have soap boxes that never before existed, and governments need to think creatively about how to respond to and manage the competing narratives proliferated by this new diffusion of communicative power to both state and non-state actors. Nye says that “if we're going to deal with these two great power shifts...we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power.”</p>

<p>South Korea was, for a long time, overshadowed by its powerful neighbors Japan and China. But today South Korea engages with the world in an ambitious online campaign deploying both websites and social networking services to communicate to foreign audiences that it is a country both culturally and economically prepared to participate in the global economy. The Republic of Korea’s online efforts to export their culture are forms of public diplomacy that translate into soft power, as evidenced by public opinion polls, tourism, and internet search trends.</p>

<p><strong>Korea since the War</strong></p>

<p>The division of the Korean peninsula after WWII eventually led North Korean forces in the still unresolved Korean War. While North Korea became dictator Kim Il-sung’s Democratic people’s republic of Korea, South Korea’s government struggled to gain stability, moving from one dictator to another. It was the <em>chaebol</em>, sprawling conglomerate firms protected by the government, that ultimately kept Korea stable domestically so it could develop a strong middle class. Scholar John Feffer says the “state-led, export-driven” path that South Korea took “departed significantly from the capitalist norm. It was a ‘miracle’ born of a different model of economic organization." (Feffer, 2005) These conglomerates were no doubt supported because of who was running them—neither the state nor the <em>chaebol</em> were immune from corruption and mismanagement—but they were nevertheless crucial to grooming today’s Korea, and remain strong political entities. The Economist noted that Hyundai, a <em>chaebol</em>, “[built Korea’s] roads and then decided to build the cars to drive on them.” (Leaders: The chaebol conundrum, 2010)</p>

<p>In 1981 Korea was selected to host the 1988 Olympic Games. Jarol Manheim noted it was an important moment that put Korea in the international spotlight, and when the nineteen-day June Democracy Movement erupted in 1987 against president Chun Doo-hwan’s government, the eyes of the world were on Seoul awaiting a reaction.</p>

<blockquote>It may or may not have been the anticipation of the Olympics that brought students into the streets in June 1987, but it was surely the anticipation of the Olympics that brought the world’s press to Seoul, Kwangju and elsewhere to cover their activities. And...the presence of the press, the negative image of South Korea it conveyed to the world, and the legitimacy it conferred on demonstrators and opposition politicians that ultimately forced the ruling party to make significant political concessions (Manheim 1990)</blockquote>

<p>The Olympics were not the reason but the “deadline for a restructuring of the political system” (Manheim 1990) At 23 years, today's Republic of Korea (ROK) is the stable product of that political change.</p>

<p>The ROK had high expectations for the ’88 Olympics. They hoped for a “Japanese experience” that would usher them “into the family of nations” (Manheim 1990) Where Japan’s goal for the Olympics was image repair, the ROK’s was hoping to alert the world that North Korea was still a threat, and build some global social capital to aid them in the ongoing conflict. They were hoping to achieve the kind of rise to global importance that Japan did after 1964. Korea's peculiar relationship with Japan after WWII, both loathing for the wartime atrocities and envious of the regional and global leader, added competitive fire to the Seoul Olympics that would define the next era of Korean history. Korea’s <em>chaebol</em> went global after the Olympics, and Korea found consumer electronics, automobiles, and semiconductors the profitable exports of the time.</p>

<p>In the 2000s, Korea shifted its focus to culture, not only through restoration of its heritage, but also by actively exporting cultural products. The result was the <em>Korean Wave</em>, a term coined by a Chinese journalist in the early 2000s to describe the rapidly rising demand for Korean goods and culture in China. Since then the wave landed on shores everywhere from Japan to Iran. The wave acts as a form of public diplomacy. As one Korean said, “If we can give [other countries] a little more joy...and show them another side of Korea, then I can only see that as a plus for us and them” (Faiola, 2010). Korean television dramas led the meteoric rise in popularity abroad. In 2004, Japan became a “full fledged” part of the wave with 90% of Japan having some knowledge of the drama “Winter Sonata” (Hayashi &amp; Lee, 2007). Korean dramas also enjoy normal airplay on television throughout Southeast Asia, even out doing Japan, the previous cultural leader, in places like Singapore. The peninsula also started packaging “K-drama tours,” where tourists visit Seoul to tour the set of their favorite dramas (Dator and Seo 2010; Datar 2010; Shim 2005). The Ministry of Culture and Tourism launched Arirang in 1998 as a “representative international broadcasting station, [that] strives to enhance relationships with the global community” by spreading the image of Korea through its TV and Radio programming. Today, Arirang commands an audience share of 91.9 million worldwide (Arirang, 2011).</p>

<p>In 2008, expanding on the success of Korean drama, the ROK started a project to globalize Korean food through the Ministry of Food, Forest, and Fisheries, with the goal of making Korean “one of the world’s most famous five” cuisines in the next ten years (Kim 2008). The government spun the project off to the private Korean Food Foundation in 2010. The foundation is running scientific experiments to prove Korean food’s fabled health value. Mr. Chung Woon-chun, the foundation’s chairman, “is currently leading [research projects] with a budget of one billion KRW<a id="anchor1" href="#note1">¹</a>&nbsp;on the link between Korean food and its effect on patients with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, hyperlipemia,” and many other diseases (Ku 2010). More compelling than examining these efforts simply as a part of a cultural phenomenon is how these function diplomatically and make the ROK more powerful.</p>

<p><strong>Online Diplomacy the Right Way, the Korean Way</strong></p>

<p>Outside of Arirang, Korea’s public diplomacy since 1988 was episodic, characterized by world events like the Olympics in 1988, the World Cup in 2002, and the G20 summit in 2010. Through these events Korea was able to bring people to the Land of the Morning Calm and put itself in the mind of the world through international press coverage. These events are high-profile, but non permanent, leaving Korea without much lasting presence outside of occasional skirmishes with the North. This prompted Korea to shift its focus to stepping up efforts to embed itself in the mind of the global community.<a id="anchor2" href="#note2">²</a></p>

<p>Part of the solution was online. The Korean Organization for Culture and Information Service (KOCIS) began operating “korea.net” in 2001 (KOCIS 2011). Despite being available in English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Japanese, the site is not translated into Korean<a id="anchor3" href="#note3">³</a>&nbsp;which suggests the KOCIS is trying to communicate everything Korean to everywhere but Korea. The Korea Food Foundation also launched Hansik.org: The Taste of Korea, to bring their mission online. Both the KFF and KOCIS are present on the major western social media outlets including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Flickr, and KOCIS recruits foreigners to write for the Korea Blog.</p>

<p>There are plenty of examples of governments bringing diplomacy online. There are fewer examples of governments doing so effectively, in part because these technologies are so new that there is not yet a clear framework for effectiveness. For example, the Voice of America, the United States’ public diplomacy engine has decades of good practices in radio behind it that shape the way their journalists approach the medium; online platforms platform are more emergent in how they should be used.</p>

<p>Nicholas J. Cull described the US State Department's attempt to use Twitter abroad in <em>Place Branding and Public Diplomacy</em>. “The first problem the US ran into was the question of exactly how its personnel would conduct themselves on-line.” Another problem was “the fixation with 'broadcast mode' in US online diplomacy,” the way the US was engaging in online diplomacy was “equivalent of going into a party and shouting about one's self and leaving,” unsavory behavior even if the US were the one "buying all the drinks." (Cull 2011) These are not problems unique to the State Department, though, a recent Pew study showed that news organizations are using Twitter as little more than “a glorified RSS feed,” pushing only their own content out to thousands of followers (Garber 2011).</p>

<p>Anthony Olcott views the situation a bit differently. He sees online public diplomacy as a challenge of managing "cheap, hyper-abundant information," and getting the state’s message out credibly above the noise of non-state actors. His "Six Vs of Information" provide a framework with which governments might approach their information management in the network economy. The "Six Vs" are: volume, velocity, vector, veracity and verifiability, and vulgarity. They do not suggest any specific policy, but offer "a starting point [for] the main challenges posed," by a society of rich information (Olcott 2010).</p>

<p>Joseph Nye and Robert Keohane identify “free information,” or what “actors are willing to create and distribute without financial compensation,” as having “the most dramatic effect on the information revolution.” (Nye and Kohane 1998) It is the “persuasiveness of the free information” disseminated by various actors that translates into power. “If a state can make its power legitimate in the eyes of others,” they argue, “and establish international institutions that encourage others to define their interests in compatible ways,” it may generate soft power. With this in mind, an analysis of KOCIS’s online diplomacy efforts within Olcott’s framework reveals South Korea is doing a remarkable job at legitimizing itself in a way that translates itself into soft power around the world.</p>

<p>The statistics about how much data is transmitted online today is impressive, but more interesting than the volume of information available is how people select what to read and what to ignore. One way is for people to "cocoon" themselves inside the "information company of those who share their interests and assumptions." (Olcott 2010) People use these cocoons to insulate themselves from the information they do not want. Cull called this our desire to find and rely on "someone like me." (Cull 2011)</p>

<p>People also engage in something called “satisficing” where they want some information about a topic, but end up acquiring a relatively small amount to what is available. Through this process of "satisficing" Olcott argues, "people are increasingly less likely to read deeply, but rather 'power browse,'" to make a superficial connection with the information they are combing. This kind of behavior is encouraged by things like RSS readers, Twitter, and Facebook which more easily give the option of reading a headline and moving on to the next thing. The problem for governments is developing ways to deal with voluminous information generated by non-state actors contrary to the state’s preferred narrative.</p>

<p>Korea’s online strategy is to make its official channels as attractive or more so than non-state actors. When KOCIS launched The Korea Blog, it took existing voices from the cocoon it was trying to infiltrate and promoted them. The information silo was foreigners who blogged about Korea, from both inside and outside of the peninsula. In 2011, the KOCIS began recruiting foreigners who were already blogging in Korea to write for The Korea Blog, the ‘web 2.0’ portion of <a href="http://korea.net">korea.net</a>, effectively promoting a few <em>someone like mes</em> from the thousands of Westerners living in Korea. KOCIS bloggers need not be in Korea, but their posts must originate on their own blog, with cross-promotion as one of the perks (Korea Blog 2011). Korea tapped into the local network of foreign bloggers, among them many English teachers expressing opinions about Korea, often loudly. By giving bloggers a higher profile venue, KOCIS is injecting itself into a community with the hope that by endorsing these foreigners, they will become influential inside their information cocoons, and outsiders or new-comers will 'satisfice' their need for information about Korea with content from <a href="http://korea.net">korea.net</a>.</p>

<p>Olcott's second V is Velocity. He compares the uptake of the viral “Pants on the Ground” video from American Idol with a video of a State Department official giving a speech to illustrate the point that some artifacts are picked up quicker than others. The lesson for public diplomacy is that the state’s information may be really, informative, interesting, even engaging and still lose out to something totally ridiculous simply because of the speed at which information travels is impossible to quantify. While it is difficult to pinpoint exactly how it is staying on top of information velocity, Korea is regularly producing new content. KOCIS’ official Twitter account (@koreanet) tweets 6.8 times per day including pictures, videos, and news articles. The blog produces 12-15 new posts per month. (Korea Blog 2011) Like news organizations and the US State Department, however, Korea's Twitter accounts may have a "talking to oneself" problem. They follow about a quarter as many people as follow them, (Twitter 2011) and rarely talk to other users on the platform.</p>

<p>Information used to be expensive, and tended to come from straightforward sources. There were a fixed number of newspapers circulating in each city, starting a radio station required vast human and capital resources. Consequently, it was easier to appear objective while presenting a specific narrative and attributed that narrative to human behavior. It was, this is to say, easier to control a sphere of influence to create the illusion of "broad social consensus," because of the predictable vector by which information was delivered (Olcott 2010).</p>

<p>In the past there were three layers of influence that directed public discourse: the spheres of deviancy, legitimate controversy, and consensus (Olcott 2010). The powers who controlled the spread of information also controlled what information populated which spheres. Today each person has the potential to be a media creator, and construct their own spheres. The chaotic vectors by which information may spread around the globe, many of them contrary to Korea’s preferred narrative, are part of Korea’s motivation to employ the available means of persuasion in an attempt at soft power.</p>

<p>Victor Cha and Katrin Katz demonstrated the misinformation about Korea in the United States through analysis of a poll for the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. They noted that despite strong support for the continued military alliance between the US and Korea, many Americans were ignorant to basic facts about the country (Cha &amp; Katz 2011). 40% of surveyed Americans did not know that Korea was a liberal democracy, and 71% were unaware that Korea was one of America's top trading partners. They speculated that this accounted for why Koreans generally feel they know more about the US than vice versa (Cha &amp; Katz 2011). Meanwhile, President Obama characterized Korea&nbsp; as a nation with whom the US had an "enduring alliance," and "a partnership of the heart, that will never be broken" (Obama 2011). Online efforts, particularly the employment of foreign bloggers to write about Korea, is a response to this relative ignorance abroad.</p>

<p>Not only are there more actors, spreading more information through more channels than ever before, but the actors responsible for information are increasingly careless where it counts: the facts. In the lurch of getting the scoop first, factual verification is often sacrificed by even the most reputable sources, exemplified by the news coverage of the attempted assassination of US Representative Gabriel Giffords. Three major media outlets <em>confirmed</em>, the representative was killed in the attacks when in fact she was still alive albeit in critical condition. NPR first reported her death at 2:15PM, per the word of "a source in the Pima County sheriff's office," and for at least an hour juggled conflicting reports about whether she was alive. (Memmott 2011) This is perhaps an illustration of all six of Olcott's V's, but "the increase in information velocity has placed even greater pressure...to get information out as quickly as possible," while reducing the amount of energy news sources can even attempt to put into verifying information (Olcott 2010).</p>

<p>Foreign bloggers who teach English in South Korea are notorious for lacking a full, verified story, and the state is aware of this. Perhaps the largest goal of the Korea Blog, then, is to discredit some of the stories perpetuated by people like Jameson Lannister, who lambasts Korean culture in her post (and video) about an altercation on the subway. The altercation between an angry elderly woman and a young female is terrifically violent, but so is the energy poured into criticizing it as a product of "cultural insanity," as a commenter put it, and a culture made up of what the author called "irrational rules and demands that are used to break people down, make them feel small, ashamed, crazy and alone" (Lannister 2010) Korea obviously does not want people abroad thinking their culture is insane, or that this kind of event is an every-day occurrence. Neither do they want people thinking that cultural norms are so difficult to parse that even their own citizens cannot understand them.</p>

<p>To respond to a situation like this, Korea has a few choices. An obvious one would be to hire people to hunt down blogs like this and post veracious comments trying to discredit her story. If they did that, however, they risk wasting time on commenters without credibility perceived as hired shills. Rather than risk losing more credibility on the topic of their own culture, KOCIS sought to saturate the web with positive imagery and bloggers who will adhere to the narrative it wants to promote. By giving already active bloggers a promoted venue and community within the official communication lines, they can more effectively respond to Lannister’s story as the one-off event it is. The best result the ROK can hope for is to discredit these bloggers and their stories as apocryphal.</p>

<p>If Lannister’s “Evil Ajumma” story is an example of blogging with a careless regard for the facts, it is an even greater artifact of vulgarity, the last of Olcott’s Vs. Vulgarity here does not mean rude or offensive language; according to Olcott the challenge governments face is the ability of ordinary people to speak ordinarily online, a classic definition of “vulgar” that derives from its Latin root for “people.” (Olcott 2010) The attention foreigners living in Korea give to events like Lannister’s Seoul Metro fight, and the language with which they describe them, are quietly contributing to an image KOCIS is working to supplant.</p>

<p>Korea’s aggressive online diplomacy is the early entrant into a broader attempt at building its image abroad, but the nation’s branding goes deeper than blogging and tweeting to international audiences, it also includes “greater involvement in addressing global issues like poverty or climate change” (Strouther 2009). It is no coincidence, then, that the government was so aggressive at securing the KORUS free trade agreement in 2011, won the 2018 Winter Olympics bid, and created a Peace Corps.-like organization called World Friends Korea (WFK) in 2009 that sent 2,000 Koreans abroad to volunteer. The plan was to make South Korea second only to the US in the number of global volunteers (Na 2009).</p>

<p>Government initiatives describe some of Korea’s public diplomacy, but a tremendous amount is done by non-state actors. Hyundai USA engaged in a kind of public diplomacy when it started the “Cash for Clunkers” program three weeks before federal funds were available. When added to existing incentives, a new Hyundai cost as low as $6,670 (Motavalli 2009). To the extent that people know they are Korean products, every LG washing machine, Samsung smartphone, or Kia automobile functions diplomatically in the same way McDonalds, Cocca-Cola, GE and Boeing represent America. As long as these companies continue to act in the state’s interest, they benefit mutually from globalization.</p>

<p><strong>The Soft Power of Pop Culture</strong></p>

<p>Joseph Nye defined soft power as “getting what you want through...the attractiveness of a country’s culture, political ideals, and policies”(Nye 2004). Shashi Tharoor, in a TED Talk said that soft power is something that emerges “partly because of governance, but partly despite governance" (Tharoor 2010) India’s entertainment industry took "a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,” and not just to people who are Indian or know about India. He tells about an illiterate woman in Senegal who travels to Dakar each week to watch her favorite Indian television program and cites an Indian soap opera being “the most popular television show in Afghan history,” despite an absence of Indian military in Afghanistan (Tharoor 2010). The show was so successful there that crime rates reportedly rose during its time slot because security personnel were too engaged with the show to do their jobs: “That’s soft power,” he said during his TED Talk, “and that is what India is developing” (Tharoor, 2010). In this context, soft power is the product of successful public diplomacy.</p>

<p>Certainly the anecdotal evidence presented in the popular and academic literature suggest this was true for the Korean Wave, at least in Asia. Some have written about the implications the Korean Wave had on domestic and international politics. Jim Dator and Yeongseok Seo wrote “Korea may be the first nation <em>consciously</em> to recognize, and...take action towards,” a "dream society of icons" where audiovisual content is more important than information and traditional goods and services (Dator &amp; Seo 2004). Doobo Shim wrote about the power of Korean companies and dramas to shape long-standing political attitudes about the country. Finally, Hayashi and Lee discussed the limited but real extent to which the drama "Winter Sonata" translated into soft power over Japan (Hayashi &amp; Lee 2007). The Korean Wave had an important role in shaping attitudes about Korea, but has not chilled the tensions between Japan and its one-time colony. (Hayashi &amp; Lee, 2007) "At best," they wrote, "the most conspicuous result of the popularity of the drama in Japan may be that an increasing number of the general public has now started to engage with South Korea as never before in the postwar period, be it in a positive or negative way" (Hayashi &amp; Lee 2007).</p>

<p>Both the Washington Post and BBC noted the recent tremendous increase in tourism to Korea, especially relative to China and Japan. The BBC reports that tourism to Korea saw a 46% increase, while China and Japan rose only 10% (Datar 2011). In 2006, Japanese women were flocking to Korea to “Catch the Korean Wave” (Faiola 2010). According to the Post, “more than 6,400 female clients” had registered with an online Korean-Japanese match making service who saw its membership “skyrocket since 2004, when ‘Winter Sonata’ became the first of many hot Korean television dramas to hit Japan” (Faiola 2010). While these figures do not bespeak any policy changes, they do reflect a shift in attitudes. Shim reminded that Korean soldiers fighting against the Vietnamese Liberation Army during the Vietnam War remained a real and fresh memory for the Vietnamese. "In this respect," Shim wrote, "Korean pop stars have contributed to improving Korea's foreign relations.… Korean actor Jang Dong-gun and actress Kim Nam-ju enjoy such popularity in Vietnam that the Vietnamese have even labelled them their ‘national' stars" (Shim 2006) Korea significantly eased years of tension between the two states through the soft power of pop culture.</p>

<p>Given how well Korea is approaching its online diplomacy strategy, it follows that these efforts should translate into a similar kind of soft power. A 2010 BBC World Service poll showed Korea’s influence around the world was relatively weak. While a little under a third of those polled in 27 countries said Korea’s influence was positive, a small plurality had no opinion one way or another. Among Asian countries, only a plurality of Indonesians viewed Korea’s influence negatively, and while most of Europe viewed Korea’s influence negatively, the Americas were mostly positive about Korea (BBC World Service 2010). The same poll from 2011 showed South Korea improve slightly from 2010, although Europe continued to view Korea’s influence negatively. In the US, the poll showed a majority of people having a favorable opinion of Korea’s influence.</p>

<p>The 2011 poll showed some change in attitude about Korea’s influence in the world, but not much. If anything the change lies in the number of people who had some opinion. In 2010, 62% of respondents though Korea's influence was either positive or negative while the rest either had no opinion or gave no response. In 2011 that number increased by 6% (BBC World Service 2010; 2011). This suggests that if Korea developed any kind of soft power, it was similar to what Hayashi and Lee found in Japan, that Korea is now on the world’s agenda, recognized as having some importance or influence, whether it is positive or negative.</p>

<p>Another method of looking at soft power is in tourism. If a country is winning the hearts and minds of people around the world, surely people will want to visit. A comparison of numbers of American visitors between 2005 and 2010 does show an increase of 122,256, despite a general decline in American overseas tourism in the same time period (KTO 2011; ITA 2011). American visitors to Korea in the 15 years between 1995 and 2010 increased by more than a quarter of a million people. As a percentage of all overseas travel by Americans, however, visits to Korea increased by only 1% (Korea Tourism Office 2010).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, these numbers alone only tell part of the story. People are motivated to travel for more reasons than a country’s reputation. People do not exclusively travel to Bermuda because of its government’s social agenda on global warming, or what people say about the culture in blogs. Travelers to Korea also do not always visit for reasons that are easily correlated with soft power. In 2005, for example, there were 3,951 E2 Work visa holders, the majority of them being English teachers (Jambor, 2008). While there is certainly something motivating Americans to work in South Korea, the country’s reputation is not necessarily among them. Paul Jambor shows the opposite may be true,;despite a generally negative bias against foreign English teachers, the number of E-2 holders increased by an easy 5,000 in 2008 (Jambor, 2008). Thus, it is likely that a significant number of the remaining tourists are motivated by friends and family that are E-2 holders, seeing the Korea KOCIS wants them to see may happen, but it is not&nbsp; always what brings them into the country.</p>

<p>This begs the question of how much online diplomacy, no matter how well crafted, can actually trigger soft power. Certainly the Korean efforts since the early 2000s seem not to have won the hearts and minds of many people abroad, slight increases in public perceptions of Korea's influence notwithstanding. But maybe Korea doesn’t want the hearts and minds. After all soft power is not necessarily about winning over the people; it is about "getting what you want" (Nye 2004).</p>

<p><strong> </strong>Perhaps Korea does not want hearts and minds, yet. Until about 20 years ago the Republic was not even a household name in some parts of the developed world. Even today the Land of the Morning Calm rarely makes global news except in the context of North Korea and high profile international events like the Olympics and the G-20 summit. With this in mind, Korea's online diplomacy effort is more in line with a traditional goal of public diplomacy: Korea wants to talk to the world from its own perspective, and for the world to listen, and talk back.</p>

<p>The KOCIS website, the blog, and the KOCIS Facebook and Twitter accounts, along with the Arirang network, and the Hansik website are all broadcasting a uniquely Korean message to anyone listening. Furthermore, some evidence that Korea has managed to etch out an ongoing narrative of its own can be seen in the change in Google search trends.</p>

<p>In 2010 search trends in the US showed North Korea was about 30% more important than South Korea, with both countries hardly having any ranking outside of military threats and the World Cup. North Korea was even more popular the previous year, with South Korea hardly making any headlines, or capturing any search terms. Indeed since 2006, North Korea has generally surpassed the South in search importance. In the last twelve months, however, search trends in the United States have favored South Korea over the North, but not by much. Peak searches and news volume for that period, however, show that South Korea was making more headlines (Google 2011; data set limited to the last twelve months; data set limited to 2010; data set limited to 2009; all available search data).</p>

<p>These data suggest that South Korea’s efforts are working. If 2012 remains consistent with 2011, even more so. Whenever it gives the world another story to cover, Korea is achieves soft power simply by capturing the attention of outsiders in its own context. They are anticipating, then, that as the world shifts its focus away from North <em>and</em> South Korea, people’s attitudes will eventually change in the South’s favor. This would correspond well with Hayashi and Lee's findings about the soft power conferred upon the Japanese by Winter Sonata; some of the world’s attention, good or bad, is on Korea.</p>

<p>The search trends, tourism statistics, and global public opinion suggest Korea achieved soft power simply by distinguishing itself on the world stage. Further research on this topic may explore the extent to which KOCIS is fostering some kind of content-based change in the way Korea is portrayed in foreign newspapers and magazines. This would be similar to Hayashi and Lee’s analysis of news coverage of the Korean Wave in Japan and Korea. Examining, for example, the content of foreign bloggers to see the extent to which Arirang and online resources are used in blog posts rather than mere observations, would reveal that these sources are being accepted inside the sphere of influence in that community. Additionally, public opinion polling around the world may eventually show a stronger correlation between public diplomacy and changing attitudes of Koreans around the world. For now, Korea’s role in the world is clearly changing, and the state is ready to participate.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Inspired by the <a href="http://googleearthtimemachine.blogspot.fr/">Google Earth Time Machine blog</a> highlighted by Kottke.org a few days ago, I decided to see how far back the imagery over my college campus reached. I figured it being in rural area, there was probably a lot of agricultural aerial photography going on, but I was wrong, the imagery only went back as far as 1992. Perhaps if I paid for some extra features it would stretch back further, but who knows. Those familiar with Gustavus Adolphus College will recall the infamous 1998 Tornado, the ten-year anniversary of which was commemorated while I was a student. The big thing I remember hearing about the campus was tree loss. The big takeaway watching the recruitment video from the 90s they were still using when I was a freshman was 'where did all those giant trees on the quad go? What I did not think about, and what never really got talked about, was how many more trees there are now, and this was immediately evident comparing the 92 aerial imagery with the photographs taken 20 years later.
<a href="http://www.harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GAC121.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1596" title="Gustavus 2012" src="http://www.harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GAC121-512x318.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="318" /></a>

One thing that was especially interesting was where there were more trees in 2012, where the trees were smaller, and where they were actually larger. The Linnaeus Arboretum sort of hugs the Westernmost part of the campus. In 2012 the Arb, as we affectionately knew it, is densely populated with trees on the North side, strikingly so compared to the same image in 1992. The South side is a bit more dense, but, being that it's a bit more prairie on that end of the Arb, it's not as noticeable. What's strange here is that all the trees actually look a lot bigger, 20 years bigger, in fact. Did the Arb somehow survive the tornado, or was it replanted with really big trees? On the South-Southeast side of the campus, headed down the hill from (the old) Old Main the tree cover is definitely sparser in '92, but the trees much larger. There are also more paved paths headed up the hill from Rundstrom Hall, something I would have welcomed when I lived there.

Apart from trees, the campus was busy constructing, moving, or demolishing campus facilities in the last twenty years. The facilities are highlighted on the 2012 map <em>supra</em> and color-coded according to whether they are sports (blue), academic (yellow), housing (green), public spaces (orange), and parking (red). I also made some notes in white. One thing is clear straight away, housing at Gustavus has changed a lot in the last twenty years. On the Southern edge of the campus were added the Arbor View Apartments, on the Western edge before the Arb, Southwest and Prairie View halls (the latter meant to be temporary after the tornado) and the International Center. On the South-Southeast side of campus (a barren patch of grass circled in green) was Wahlstrom Hall, a building demolished the summer before I enrolled. Gusties have also changed the way they play sports, with the football field moved to behind Lund Center on the North End of campus. The new stadium, built in the summer of 2007, is right next to a soccer field, and is across Ring Rd. from a baseball field and a multi-purpose field for practices (and other things? My golf class met there, I imagine that's not all). All of these fields are either new or have moved since 1992. The 2012 stadium is directly atop the 1992 baseball field, and the 2012 baseball and multi-purpose fields appear to be atop 1992's farmland. It's not clear whether the rugby pitch behind Southwest Hall is new, or if it was so used in 1992. The 1992 football stadium is now covered by a mall stretching NE from Christ Chapel, one of two new public spaces. The others were an expansion of the campus center that happened after the tornado to include the Marketplace, and the creation of the Big Hill Farm West of the Arb.

<a href="http://www.harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GAC92.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1594" title="Gustavus 1992" src="http://www.harmsboone.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GAC92-512x319.png" alt="" width="512" height="319" /></a>

The last thing I noted was how little the campus expanded its academic buildings. The three buildings in yellow are Mattson Hall, housing the Nursing and Education Departments; Old Main, renovated in 2005; and Beck Academic Hall completed about one year ago. This illustration of how the campus has changed is by no means scientific. Certainly academics can expand without constructing new buildings unlike, say, housing, and it's possible some of these buildings were renovated internally, or that departments were moved around campus as they outgrew their homes. The old library, better known as the SSC in my day or A. H. Anderson Hall officially, is currently not occupied by any department, though I believe is still used for its classrooms (correct me if I'm wrong). The departments that were once there have all moved to Beck Hall now. It is nevertheless interesting to think about this aerial transformation in terms of a college's priorities.

I'm far from the first to note that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/business/colleges-begin-to-confront-higher-costs-and-students-debt.html?pagewanted=all">college</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/05/16/136214779/college-student-debt-grows-is-it-worth-it">costs</a> <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/26/pf/college/college_tuition_cost/index.htm">are</a> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2012/03/19/why-college-prices-keep-rising/">on</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130895432">the</a> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/how-in-the-world-did-college-costs-rise-15-in-only-2-years/258463/">rise</a>, and I'm far from the first to wonder why colleges <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/pitchroom/are-college-sports-worth-the-cost/7827/">seem to spend more on fancy athletic and housing facilities than the academic program</a> (and whether that even matters), and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/05/28/120528taco_talk_lemann">what drives</a> <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/college_bound/2012/04/some_perspective_on_the_high_cost_of_college.html">spending by college administrators</a>. Nevertheless, it is hard to argue that, at least from a bird's eye view, my college seems to have its priorities in two key areas: athletics, and student facilities.

<blockquote>
  <p>The United States Constitution instructed the First Congress of the United States to enact laws ``securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' This instruction, commonly referred to as the Intellectual Property Clause, demanded a set of laws based on the broad idea that inventors are best incentivized and remunerated for their works through a system of guaranteed exclusive rights. What exactly the scope of those rights were, who had authority to hand them out, and under what conditions they would be given, were all left to Congress to sort out; it was among the earliest controversies over science and technology in the United States of America. <!--more--></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In the United States of America, the working definition of a patent is best encapsulated not in US Code, but from the United Nations’ World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). One of a handful of specialized UN agencies, WIPO’s mission is “to promote… a balanced and effective international intellectual property (IP) system.” Today, U.S. IP law is as much shaped by WIPO treaties and other international agreements as by the U.S. Congress. On its face a patent is nothing more than a legal document but the legal power endowed upon it is mighty. A patent grants to an inventor the power to exclude and determine who is allowed to ‘practice,’ or “make, use, or build,” an invention, in exchange the inventor must disclose in some detail how the technology could be made, used, and built (WIPO). A journey through time will show America’s first patent law respond to a specific set of concerns and gave society a way of answering the question: what is technology?</p>

<p>sThe United States Constitution empowered the United States Congress “to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries” (US Constitution, Art. 1, §8, Cl. 8.). The exact scope of those rights, who administered them under what conditions and for how long were all left to Congress to sort out; it was among the earliest controversies over science and technology in the United States of America. The resulting law, the Patent Act of 1790, created a paradigm for how the United States understood the ideas of invention, technology, and science.</p>

<p>Intellectual Property Rights are not the only means of incentivizing creative work, but it had been the custom for many centuries before the Constitution was written. In his “Theories of Intellectual Property,” William Fisher argued for four broad ways of thinking about IP: utilitarian, natural rights, humanist, and desirable society perspectives. Thomas Jefferson reluctantly accepted IP rights as a <em>desirable society utilitarian’s</em> solution to the problem of incentivizing invention. To Jefferson’s (and, he would argue America’s) chagrin “the exclusive right to invention” is given “for the benefit of society,” at the risk of “embarrassment” from its unintended consequences (Jefferson 1813). As Edward Walterscheid tells in his 1997 article “Charting a Novel Course: The Creation of the Patent Act of 1790” there was robust debate in the late 18th Century. Input came from President Washington, Jefferson, inventors, and many others regarding what Congress should do.</p>

<p>The Patent Act of 1790 was a response to a specific set of problems unique to the early United States. It established a policy paradigm the legislation thereafter served to articulate in the same way that “normal science” did for Kuhn’s scientific paradigms (Kuhn 1970). Peter Hall called this “normal policymaking”, in which the established paradigm sets goals around which future policy will operate.</p>

<p>This paper is less concerned with the virtue of the law, about which a great deal has been written by legal scholars that will inform this work. Rather, it will examine the debate and proposals that interpreted the only precedent the US Congress had in its first three years—the Constitution—around the question of what constituted technology in the young republic. It holds that the Patent Act of 1790 was paradigmatic in the sense that Hall extrapolated “policy paradigms” from Kuhn’s scientific and technological paradigms (Hall1993, Kuhn 1970). The law settled a set of specific questions and problems and served as the answer to all disputes until such a time when the relevant parties no longer found the law adequate.</p>

<h1>Intellectual Property Policy Paradigms</h1>

<p>Peter Hall saw policymaking as essentially a process of social learning that “involves three central variables: the overarching goals that guide policy in a particular field, the techniques or policy instruments used to attain those goals, and the precise settings of these instruments.” Using British economic policy from 1970-89 as his object of inquiry, he illustrated a paradigm shift. He argued to think about three orders of policy change, the first and second of which he called “normal policymaking” [@Hall1993]. The third was “marked by the radical changes in the overarching terms of policy discourse” that sometimes led to paradigm shifts.</p>

<p>First and second order changes do not necessarily lead to third order changes. In Kuhn’s terms, normal policymaking has the effect of “further articulation and specification under new or more stringent conditions” (Kuhn 1970). First order change is characterized by “incrementalism, satisficing, and routinized decision making” (Hall 1993). Hall noted first order changes were made every year during the time period he studied. Second order changes happen less frequently; they “alter the instruments… without radically altering the hierarchy of goals behind [the] policy.” In British economic policies, these were changes to the controls on lending and monetary policy routinely made each year (Hall 1993).</p>

<p>A third order change is much more profound, and far rarer. In British economic policy it was a radical shift from the “Keynesian mode of policymaking to one based on monetarist economic theory” (Hall 1993). Third order changes are informed by “policy experimentation and policy failure” and can lead to “movement from one paradigm to another.” The United States Constitution’s Intellectual Property Clause prompted the First Congress to establish a paradigm for granting IP rights.</p>

<h1>Pre-paradigmatic Environment: The Colonies Confederation, and the Constitution</h1>

<p>Edward Walterscheid (1997), showed that IP rights derived from English law abounded in the American Colonies (Walterscheid 1997). Frank D. Prager, writing earlier than Walterscheid, showed that those laws were in turn inspired by even earlier Venetian laws protecting inventions and creative works (Prager 1944). A brief discussion of this custom is necessary to understand the controversy that shaped the first Patent Act.</p>

<p>By the time the American Colonies were legislating, intellectual property rights were generations old (Prager 1944). The Continental Congress, the legislative body under the Articles of Confederation, did not issue any patents or enact any laws establishing a patent <em>system</em> but “there was nonetheless a patent <em>custom</em> extant in both the infant United States and in Great Britain….” That custom, not operating through any formal mechanisms was, by 1787, “timeworn” and failing to address the technological needs of the American and English societies (Walterscheid 1997, emphasis added). The only explicit mention of inventions in law came from South Carolina’s copyright statute which extended the same rights to inventors of “useful machines” as authors had over their writings. It did not, however, create any kind of formal system by which those rights would be conferred. “Consequently, the granting of each patent… required a special act of the legislature” (Walterscheid 1997, Prager1944). This South Carolinian custom would be demonstrated by inventors in petitions to Congress.</p>

<p>What little policy made during the Colonial and Articles of Confederation eras was first and second order policy change. The aging custom of common law IP rights had yet to be replaced. The Constitution prompted a third order change to codify a uniform patent <em>system</em> across all the states in the union. After the constitution was adopted, inventors sought from Congress, a paradigm shift.</p>

<h1>Building a Paradigm: Controversy in Congress</h1>

<p>The First Congress’s goal was simple: grant IP rights. The Constitution said nothing about what those rights should look like or whether they should be create some kind of system or grant them individually as in colonial South Carolina. Walterscheid noted that the First Congress started receiving petitions from inventors waiting for legislation “almost immediately.” The petitioners wanted Congress to individually assign a unique right for each invention. Congress, overwhelmed with all the other obligations it had per the Constitution. The authors and inventors wanted answers from Congress about what they had in mind for a law: how generic it would be, whether one law would cover both inventors and authors, what would happen to them upon death, and how the assignment process would work. Congress did what it would probably do today on a question it had never before considered, “it appointed a committee” (Walterscheid 1997, 458).</p>

<p>Less than a month after Congress convened inventors David Rumsey and John Churchman’s petitions were heard in the House posing just these questions. The committee interviewed Churchman about how his navigational instruments worked and responded directly to him saying that he should be given some kind of exclusive right for a “term of years”, but stopped short of actually giving him one or any indication of how many years it had in mind. The committee’s report generated added controversy within Congress when it recommended giving Churchman “further encouragement to his ingenuity,” upon proof of his invention’s success. Another issue to consider: whether the power given to Congress was to <em>reward</em> or simply <em>encourage</em> inventors (Walterscheid1997, 456-459).</p>

<p>More petitions came from inventor Alexander Lewis claiming to have discovered a novel way of “impelling boats… through the water, against any current or stream,” and asking Congress to pass a law securing a twenty-one year exclusive right to “construct boats upon his model.” Inventor Arthur Greer, asked for the same term length, but specifically used the word patent, for his navigational discoveries, and a third, Englehart Cruse asked for an eight year term over his “improved steam engine.” All of these (and presumably more) were ordered to lie on the table [@Walterscheid1997, 459]. Finally, a petition from John Fitch asked for an exclusive right, not just to build, construct or use the invention, but to enjoin others, like Rumsey, from improving upon his steam boat invention. Fitch also claimed to have exclusive rights over his inventions in several states (Walterscheid 1997, 460-462).</p>

<p>To the extent these petitioners imagined a uniform system for applications, it was in wondering whether Congress might impose one. Each hoped congress would issue a special right over their unique inventions (Walterscheid 1997, Prager 1954). The issues raised nevertheless became central questions for a future patent system: what was a technology (or a Useful Art), and how long was sufficient enough time to protect it to promote their discovery? They were the issues the English system and common law traditions failed to address and were crucial for the First Congress in crafting legislation.</p>

<p>If Prager’s 1954 account is any indication, the public debate surrounding any patent legislation was a battle between Fitch and Rumsey over a perennial question of patent policy: what shall be done with simultaneous discovery? Rumsey wanted a public examination system like that in France, while Fitch wanted a jury mechanism to determine which invention came first similar to Webster’s proposal. On another level Fitch and his supporters also argued that any American system should be predicated on public declarations and disclosures of their inventions, rather than a more secretive but expedient system of closed examination favored by Rumsey. In the end both parties won some part of the argument in the final Patent Act (Prager 1954).</p>

<p>Walterscheid told the story more completely. While Rumsey and Fitch traded barbs, Congress attempted to make law. The first bill introduced built a system aimed at addressing the petitions and solving the many problems the English system faced. Patentability of improvements, for example, was a question for English courts, rather than Parliament, because England’s aging system had no mechanism to deal with them directly; Congress, however, had no system so it could take on that question (Walterscheid 1997).</p>

<p>The bill introduced on June 23, 1789 was ultimately ordered to lie on the table because Congress could not pass it and had other, more pressing things to consider by the session’s end (Walterscheid 1997).</p>

<p>By the opening of its second session, Congress was fully inundated with petitions asking for individual rights for inventions ranging from mills and sundry engines to lightning rods and wheeled boats. Added urgency came from President Washington who, in his 1790 address to a joint session, implored Congress to act on the Intellectual Property Clause and recommended that whatever legislation passed, it include some mechanism for importing useful inventions from abroad. The Senate, responded saying it would pass legislation when it deemed appropriate and the House appointed a committee “look into” his recommendations.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Congress wanted the granting of exclusive rights to be handled in a system, rather than an arbitrary case-by-case basis (Walterscheid 1997, 492-498).</p>

<h1>A new Technological Order</h1>

<p>Finally, in 1790, a patent bill was introduced that eventually passed and settled all the controversy described <em>supra</em>. The Act was paradigmatic in that it established a system within which instruments of public policy could be created and predictably used to issue IP rights for technologies.</p>

<h2>What did Congress Say?</h2>

<p>Congress laid out some specifics based on the controversies identified by petitions sent between 1787 and 1790, though mostly these revolved around the formal operation of the system. Congress declared, for example, that inventions worthy of an exclusive right needed to be “sufficiently useful and important,” and would only be granted for a period of fourteen (14) years. Applications would be examined by a patent board within the State Department consisting of the Secretaries of State and War and the Attorney General. Inventors were required to provide a “specification in writing and a drawing, and a model if possible” (Federico 1936, 237). Many were rejected if they lacked a working model. Filing for a patent would cost about five dollars.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>One concern of many petitioners regarded whether State patents would be honored as Federal patents. That answer was simply, no. All inventions would have to apply to the Patent Board—consisting of the Secretary of State (Thomas Jefferson), the Attorney General (Edmund Randolph), and the Secretary of War (Henry Knox)—and obtain an original patent. All those who petitioned Congress from 1787 through 1790 would have to file a patent like all other inventors. Rather than attempt to enumerate for the Board a list of criteria, Congress gave broad authority to these three to determine what constituted a “useful and important” invention “not before known or used” (Federico1936, Citing the Patent Act of 1790, p. 238).</p>

<p>Federico wrote that Jefferson was likely the most influential board member because of his many useful and important inventions, some of which earned him awards in France, none of which were patented.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> These three individuals would “meet from time to time and discussed the applications” pending before the Board. Jefferson elucidated the “rules and regulations ” by which these applications would be evaluated through various letters to citizens looking for guidance on licensing or patenting some invention. As legal scholar P.J. Federico wrote about the Act, “a personal letter form Jefferson probably represents an action on an application” (Federico 1936, 239-243).<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Patentability quickly became shaped by what was technology. Jefferson was clear in his letter to Isaac McPherson that new uses for old technologies did not merit a patent, an improvement upon it, however, did (Jefferson 1813). In that same letter, Jefferson identified three rules the Board used that arose largely out of his desirable society view of intellectual property. Exclusive rights, monopolies as he called them, were granted not to protect a natural right, rather they are given for the benefit of society. Putting an old technology to new use did not bring enough benefit to merit a monopoly over that use. Neither did changing the material from which a machine was made: “Making a plowshare of cast rather than of wrought iron” was not sufficiently inventive because it was still a plowshare. His final rule said that “a change of form” was not an invention. A horseshoe was a horseshoe regardless of whether it was “high-quartered” or low (Jefferson1813, Federico 1936). These three rules were not, however, a complete or exhaustive list of the criteria used to judge applications. Federico notes that Jefferson had strong beliefs that “small devices, obvious improvements or…frivolous devices,” should not receive the protections of a patent (Federico 1936, 241). This system was not perfect, but did manage to give both Fitch and Rumsey patents for their respective steamboat inventions.</p>

<p>A report from the clerk’s office showed that of the 114 applications the Board received, only 49 patents were granted during the Act’s first three years [@Federico1936, 246]. As for the 14 steamboat or engine petitions, a Congressional hearing was held and ultimately determined that each invention was uniquely novel and could therefore be patented. Federico described the patent regime established as “conservative” with a keen attention to the scope of the rights being granted (Federico 1936). Jefferson wanted to hold ‘invention’ to a high standard. He worried that too many patents for too inconsequential of discoveries would be embarrassing to the young republic.</p>

<h1>Conclusion: A return to normal science</h1>

<p>Science and Technology Studies (STS) scholars have a history of analyzing the politics of techno-scientific events. Steven Epstein analyzed the politics of inclusion in clinical trials as well as the political transfer from lay person to expert in the controversies of the AIDS epidemic (Epstein 2009, Epstein 1995). More removed from politics, Bruno Latour’s Actor Network Theory is a suitable methodology for studying how a complicated system functions and produces knowledge (Latour 1988). Both Epstein and Latour’s methods could be useful frameworks for examining a lawmaking process; especially one with many nuanced actors like patent regime’s. Sheila Jasanoff wrote more specifically about the formal political process and the roles of STS in advising policymakers (Jasanoff 2011). Her perspective on the tension between highly technological societies and democracy are useful when thinking about passing a normative judgement on a set of policies, particularly if the rules a democracy sets up governing what is or is not technology are the object of study.</p>

<p>This essay, however, sought to understand how the United State’s first patent system came about and the controversies that informed it. To that end, Hall’s notions of policy paradigms were more useful because of its focus on policy being oriented toward goals based on a specific view of how a part of the world works. In Hall’s account of policy paradigms, the new economic order established was one that was “based on a fundamentally different conception of how the economy itself worked.” The shift in British Economics was a radical departure from Keynesian theory and fiscal tools to neoclassical economics and monetary policy tools [@Hall1993]. In the account here, the Americans saw a dramatic shift away from a <em>custom</em> to a <em>codified system</em> for intellectual property rights. The decay of the former and its failure to address new questions of patentability combined with a Constitutional call provoked a third order policy change that set a paradigm changing the fundamental goals of the State regarding the promotion of the “Useful Arts”.</p>

<p>Just as a Kuhnian scientific paradigm ushers in a new wave of “normal science,” (Kuhn 1970), so a policy paradigm brings forth a period of “normal policymaking.” Hall says that after a paradigm shift, first and second order policies are adopted to do the work of “[adjusting] policy without challenging the overall terms” set by the paradigm (Hall1993, 279). Evidence of this in the 1790 Patent Act can be seen immediately following its passage when Congress created the patent clerk (Federico1936). This is a clear first order change where “policy at time-1” (the creation of the clerk) is “deliberately” and directly influenced by “the outcomes of policy at time-0” (the need for one created by the Act). They happen frequently and largely respond to unforeseen consequences of past policy and “new developments” (Hall 1993, 281). The issuing of patents had the collective result of incrementally defining what was and was not useful, obvious, or otherwise patentable. Supreme Court decisions following the Patent Act also shaped this answer as well as the limits of Congressional power for granting patents.</p>

<p>Second order changes are rarer than first but not as profound as third order, paradigm shifting, actions. According to Hall they are instrumental adjustments that change the mechanisms underlying the current paradigm, but not its “hierarchy of goals” (Hall 1993). Walterscheid notes that few were happy with the Patent Act of 1790: not Jefferson, nor the other officials, nor inventors (more than half of whom were rejected by the Patent Board). Congress acted quickly to amend it to essentially remove the examination process inventors and officials alike thought stymied the system. Despite the fact that the system had changed from “one of registration rather than examination,” (Walterscheid 1999) this second Act is only a second order change because it preserved the central goal of the 1790 Act which moved the United States from “a patent custom to a patent system in the United States” (Walterscheid 1997) The standards for obtaining a patent still included non-obviousness and usefulness standards, it was still a formal application and fee based system universally applied, and it remained predicated on the idea that the in exchange for a monopoly over their production and use, useful inventions and discoveries would be disclosed to the public (Walterscheid 1997).</p>

<p>Today, the United States is at a juncture in Intellectual Property policy where new innovations and global governance organizations are pushing the limits of our current patenting paradigm. These new phenomena putting pressure on US Code Title 35 it may not be prepared to sustain. Understanding how IP area paradigms were created and overhauled in the past can be useful to inform these contemporary discussions. The controversy leading to the 1790 Patent Act is one such informative instance. Further examination of Patent Legislation over time will show how for long normal policy making continued after 1790 and at what point it began to fail as new inventions (like methods and software) and patenting mechanisms (like patent pools and thickets) that Congress could not anticipate in its first Act.</p>

		<title>You&#039;re Back? Retuning to Seoul, three years later.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was about three years ago that we said good bye to the Land of the Morning Calm, a sad day I think both of us will remember for many years to come. <a href="http://www.harmsboone.org/on-the-hogwon">For all the struggles of living and breathing Korea for that year</a>, it was a place that we came to love more than any other place outside our own homes. When it came time to return this week, we found ourselves at a loss for all the things we wanted to do. There was so much we never experienced while we were here, and even more that we wanted to relive, but where to start? We decided on Ilsan.<!--more-->

Our quiet suburb community north west of Seoul was never much to get excited about, in our experience, but we did spend more time there than any other place in the peninsula. We weren't sure what to expect. Would our old apartment still be there? Would lake park <a href="http://www.harmsboone.org/a-diamond-in-the-rough">still have its magical charms</a>? What about any of the places we liked to eat and drink at? Things seemed to turnover so rapidly when we were living here that we fully expected all our favorite haunts to be closed. 

When we stepped off the train at Jeongbalsan station, the first thing we noticed was though the construction was finished, the station remained familiar. The Lotte department store where we naively thought we could buy some sheets for our bed was still there, Aram Nuri art center was just as impressive as it had been when we had attended the strange adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, and most of all we remembered how green Ilsan was. Tree lined streets, large parks, and plenty of outdoor spaces rambled on in all directions in Ilsan.

Some things had changed: CVS's new chain CU (for CVS and U) seems to have taken the place of all Family Marts (홤이리마트), the grocery store across the street from our apartment is now a Lotte owned supermarket, and many of the bars on Meat Street had turned over—I'm not sure I recognized a single one. But our favorite galbi joint, Ooya Ooya (우야우야) still served up some delicious King Galbi and an excellent array of banchon, and not only was our favorite brunch spot still standing, we were greeted with 'you're back?' from the shop's owner. It felt nice to be remembered, and even nicer to have so much to remember. 

Between lunch and dinner we wandered through lake park, and noticed the Goyang One Mount Water Park and Snow Park to the northwest of the Spectacular Musical Fountain. This was the major Kintex expansion that was under construction while we were living here, and now it was nearly complete. The water park was huge (I assume it is somehow converted into the snow park only in the winter) and all around it were dozens of shops, fast food, and high end restaurants that would be perfect companions to any family hitting up the water park for a weekend getaway. It was hard to imagine how differently we might have found Ilsan with this kind of commerce near the lake. Some of the food looked genuinely good (I'm looking at you, New York Burger) but on the other hand it was just more commerce in a city that already felt over saturated to us.

The rest of the lake was as we remembered it. Sprawling, elaborate, complete, and 100% intentional. We walked through the Wild Plang Garden and remembered how even though we were seeing exactly the intended experience, it was nevertheless refreshing to have a place in our backyard where the roar of highways, scooter delivery drivers, and the city could be masked by crickets, birds and the wind in the trees. Where we could walk, bike, or meander 5k loop around the lake on a nice afternoon, and even feel, if briefly, that we were in nature. And there was even opportunity for some new discoveries.

The Goyang Sanitation Center was a site I always assumed was some kind of engine room where the lake water was cycled through and purified, but yesterday I learned how wrong that assumption was. Upon closer inspection we discovered the Toilet Culture Museum which was, like the Artificial Waterfall across the lake, very straightforwardly named. Inside we discovered a small exhibit of toilets throughout history, from the Roman flush toilets to the hybrid vaporizing toilets supposedly common in the US. Though the translation budget was apparently quite low, it was a surprising exhibit staffed by four Ajummas, one of whom was asleep on a bench in the middle of the exhibit, that shed light on the at times bizarre poo-imagery we noticed when we lived in Korea, and gave us both more information about different cultures' relationships with human feces than we ever thought we'd know. 

Korea was always a surprising and enlightening place, and we're glad that while some things definitely have changed, that has not. Little surprises were what made Korea interesting in the first place, and it's largely what pulled us to come back.

		<title>The 2013 Chuncheon Makguksu and Dalkgalbi Festival</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Each year in August the small city of Chuncheon, about an hour by express commuter rail from Seoul, hosts a week-long festival celebrating two specific Korean dishes: makguksu and dakgalbi. Apparently this year the town decided that late June was a more suitable time for the festival this year, and thank goodness because we're really glad we got to go. 

Dakgalbi, a casserole made from chicken ribs, rice cakes, red pepper paste, cabbage, and a few other things depending on where you're eating it, was one of the first Korean dishes we ever had and easily among our top favorites. It's prepared on a giant skillet in the middle of the table and shared among everyone present. We had been craving it since the moment we got off the airplane. 

Makguksu was new, at least we're pretty sure we had never had it before. It reminded us of bibimguksu, except with buckwheat noodles and possibly a different kind of broth. It's a chilled noodle soup with a radish, anchovy, or beef broth. I think we had the radish variety. Apart from the noodles, the soup was a lot of different vegetables, some kimchi, and red pepper paste.

Picking a place to eat makguksu was not hard, though it definitely could have been. The festival took place in a large field directly outside the train station that we understand was once a military camp. The food tents formed a outer wall for the festival, with banners above them alternating blue and red, for the soup and the chicken, respectively. Despite what must have been two dozen possible choices, we were so hungry we sat down at the first one we came across. 

After eating we walked around the festival, but eventually the heat became too much to bear, and with a surprising lack of shade, we reluctantly headed to a cafe for iced drinks to plan the rest of our day. We wanted to see some of the amazing lakes and streams that Chuncheon is famous for but didn't have the will to jump in a cab, so we headed to Gongjicheon, a small stream running between the lakes nestled into Chuncheon's mountains. It always struck us as amazing how well Koreans do the outdoors. Gongjicheon, like so many other parks and wilderness areas was beautiful, with well maintained walking, running, and biking paths (this park had at least 12k of track along its rivers and lakes). We ended up having a our dakgalbi not at the festival, but at a little shop along the stream. It might have been the best dakgalbi we've ever had. The chicken was excellent, and the vegetable combinations were perfect. I guess that's what happens when you get it from the source.]]></content:encoded>
